<sup>**warning:** is likely not 100% up to date because i am lazy and also constantly tweaking things.</sup>
<sup>**update:** i got atom working so more likely to be up-to-date now :) i have mixed feelings, the text is so small and its in dark mode :/ could i change both of those things? likely yes. will i? no, i like suffering.
