you should, but for some reason you haven't:
- hey bro did you ever fix chisaki's LINE user name
- probably go back through and fix up tweets before ch10
- - guess what i *didnt do*
- youtube template/css is ugly. does that bother you enough to rewrite it into something legible?
- i think some 100 width somewhere is still screwing things up with ao3
- i changed dm-container to have a max of 100 and a min of 97 and i think that messed things up but
- - actually this is fine maybe
- - i dont think it fixed the issue tho
- did mei's name get changed everywhere
- fix twitter skin (span to p) (also the new icon bar, the spacing is inconsistent)
- make templates for twitter search and... something else but i forget
- - we did this but where did it go
- change out the new twitter icons for real images, not discord images. also ~~consider making them transparent~~ make them transparent. that would be real uggo as is on a black bg.
- kazuho's line name is inconsistent; gotta choose between "Kazuho" and "Kazuho Haneyama", and im thinking the second
- totally forgot about the "read #" on line group convos, gotta add that back
- TWITTER USES SEP, NOT SEPT. AHHHH.
- twitter header is broken in most places
- litter in custom emotes
- you have fixed code for the vertical twitter line, so use it (gotta  figure out what its called/how to format, but its in the qcon chapter a lot)
- new parser update breaks all twitter, ch3 and ch14? are fixed but nothing else.
- have to remove all 'shift-up' from discord sections now due to change in ao3 margin handling; also may need to delete extra empty paragraphs, ao3 is nbsp-ing those on its own now

i THINK i already:
- did the change from "dc-name-color" to "dc-name dc-color"
- all the dc elbows (did not verify that they all worked tho so here's hoping nothing broke )
- cleaned the code for new twitter icons with viewable impressions

***update twitter sections. done on:

haha guess what, you have to redo all of these now. :)


error reports:
[chapter 1]
- Is crawler's handle supposed to be on the same line as the "<- Tweet"? Because it appears so on my phone (android). Same with Enon's tweet later in the chapter
- Blood Love's first message on the discord, her name overlaps with the discord header
[chapter ?]
- "overlapping lines with twitter in previous chapters"
