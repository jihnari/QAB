you should, but for some reason you haven't:
- hey bro did you ever fix chisaki's LINE user name
- should probably go back through and fix up tweets before ch10
- youtube template/css is ugly. does that bother you enough to rewrite it into something legible?
- i changed dm-container to have a max of 100 and a min of 97 and i think that messed things up but
- did mei's name get changed everywhere
- discord update pushed for 11-15, still need to do 1-10 but might update twitter while we're at it?
- new discord update (elbow)... wasnt changed anywhere, i think. change implemented as of ch16.
- i think some 100 width somewhere is still screwing things up with ao3
