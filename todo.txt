you should, but for some reason you haven't:
- hey bro did you ever fix chisaki's LINE user name
- probably go back through and fix up tweets before ch10
- - guess what i *didnt do*
- youtube template/css is ugly. does that bother you enough to rewrite it into something legible?
- i think some 100 width somewhere is still screwing things up with ao3
- i changed dm-container to have a max of 100 and a min of 97 and i think that messed things up but
- - actually this is fine maybe
- - i dont think it fixed the issue tho
- did mei's name get changed everywhere
- fix twitter skin (span to p) (also the new icon bar, the spacing is inconsistent)
- make templates for twitter search and... something else but i forget
- - we did this but where did it go
- change out the new twitter icons for real images, not discord images. also ~~consider making them transparent~~ make them transparent. that would be real uggo as is on a black bg.
- kazuho's line name is inconsistent; gotta choose between "Kazuho" and "Kazuho Haneyama", and im thinking the second
- totally forgot about the "read #" on line group convos, gotta add that back 


i THINK i already:
- did the change from "dc-name-color" to "dc-name dc-color"
- all the dc elbows (did not verify that they all worked tho so here's hoping nothing broke )
- cleaned the code for new twitter icons with viewable impressions
