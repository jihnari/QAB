This article certainly has garnered a lot of attention! And for good reason. It's beautifully written, and I know All Might himself would shed a tear at the way you portray him.

Given how many comments there are already I'm unsure if you'll see this. But in the case that you do, I wanted to let you know that I found this to be an incredibly thoughtful take on hero society as a whole. You've given me a lot to consider. As a veteran of the industry, it gives me hope that there are young people like you ready to take the reigns.

I cried reading this. I'm always so worried that as an outsider in heroics, I'll end up misunderstanding or misrepresenting things, so it really means a lot to me to hear you say that. <br/><br/>Thank you for your service, and I'm so glad you took the time to reach out! <br/><br/><b>Reply</b></p>
