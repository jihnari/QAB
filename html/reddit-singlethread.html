Well to start with ditch that accelerant. You want it to look like an accident, which means no outside chemicals. If the house has a gas burning stove you could always turn that on, light a candle, and leave. Don't forget to make sure all the windows are closed.<br/><br/>It's not as satisfying, but it'll get the job done. <br/>
