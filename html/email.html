Yes, that is unfortunately what I'm saying. Do you remember setting up the domain for your blog? When you register a domain, you also have to provide contact information for that domain. It's not uncommon for people to use their real information for this contact information, but it is accessible to anyone who knows where to look.

This is probably going to sound really creepy, but is xxx-xxx-xxx still your number? That's also included on the whois for your domain.

This might not make you feel better, but I promise, I'm just a normal college student. I do computers as a hobby, and follow Hawks' Twitter. I swear I didn't look you up, but if you're underage that makes this all the more important.

If you call me, I can help you take this information offline.

My number:
