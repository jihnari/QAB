<div class="fadeout"><p>
Thursday evening, a group of Naruhata University students helped reunite lost 5 year old child with her mother. One of the students possessed a locating quirk and used it to help the little girl find her mother. Some public concerns were raised over the illegal quirk usage, and when we reached out to the Ikebukuro city police station, the police chief issued the following statement:
</p>
<p>
"The students [...] did use their quirks but the quirk usage was not publicly visible nor did the illegal usage lead to additional crimes. There are no charges being pressed at this time. However, we did call their parents."

This article certainly has garnered a lot of attention! And for good reason. It's beautifully written, and I know All Might himself would shed a tear at the way you portray him.

Given how many comments there are already I'm unsure if you'll see this. But in the case that you do, I wanted to let you know that I found this to be an incredibly thoughtful take on hero society as a whole. You've given me a lot to consider. As a veteran of the industry, it gives me hope that there are young people like you ready to take the reigns.

<p class="name-header">Quirkless treatment in society? </p>
<p>
I'd never thought about it before this week's article, but do quirkless people have it worse than people with useless cosmetic quirks? Functionally they're about the same, so I've always thought society also treated them the same.

<div class="vr1"> <strong>SaffronLief </strong> <span class="slightly-weak"> Score hidden · 4 hours ago</span> <br/>
The treatment not the same at all, but not for the reasons you might think. The problem isn't quirkless discrimination; it's quirk discrimination.

It use to be leagues more difficult to get a job with a "villainous" quirk than with no quirk at all. Up until (relatively) recently, that was still very much the case. And then, about 30 years back, the government changed the way Kojin Bangou<sup>[<a href="#note1" title="Kojin Bangou" rel="nofollow">1</a>]</sup> were assigned to counter rampant identity fraud.

In the last 5-10 years as the people with the fraud-proof Kojin Bangou started to enter the workforce, the unfortunate trend of "quirk fronting" emerged. In direct response to this, an overwhelming number of individuals with "villainous" quirks started identifying as quirkless. Under the old Kojin Bangou system, (or even before the Medical Privacy act,) quirkless status was easy to verify. Under the new governance, verification can take up to three months. And that's not even taking into account the new fees and restrictions with Kojin Bangou related requests.

What it boils down to is that employers don't want to hire someone with a "villainous" quirk, and if you say you're quirkless they assume you're lying. There's a much higher population of people with "villainous" quirks than people who are "quirkless", and to this day there's still a lot of quirk fraud happening.

edit: For those of you looking for more info, look up the Sugihara vs Softbank case. The ruling on that case has made it near impossible to hold employers accountable for quirk/quirkless discrimination. <br/><br/><p class="vr1"><strong>soho2025 </strong><span class="slightly-weak"> Score hidden · 1 hour ago </span> <br/> You can inversely lie about having a quirk/fake a <em>different</em> quirk, but that's grounds for immediate termination and a fine. Sometimes it's worth it, though (speaking from personal experience.)  <br/><br/><span class="vr1"><strong>CloudedThoughts </strong><span class="slightly-weak">Score hidden · 1 hour ago </span> <br/>I don't know where you're located, but not in Tokyo it's not. If you're caught, you get entered into an internal database all major companies in Japan (and the majority of companies in Tokyo/Osaka) pull from. On the other hand, if you're working for a small, privately owned business, it's real easy to get away with saying you have something that's harder to verify, like an analysis quirk. Wonder how long it'll take them to catch on to that trend and the analytical quirked people are pulled down to our level... <br/><br/></span><br/></p><span class="vr1"><strong>5w4nn </strong> <span class="slightly-weak">Score hidden · 2 hours ago </span> <br/>There's no way an employer can legally force you to show your quirk during an interview, but I lost a job opportunity because I wasn't willing to show off my quirk and the guy after me was.
