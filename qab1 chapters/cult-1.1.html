The majority posts on the virtually unknown and largely unpopular personal blog titled "Quirk Analysis Blog for the Future" are lengthy, rambling, nonsensical, and largely impartial dissertations on various quirks. Some of these dissertations are obviously based off of popular heroes of the last decade. Others are seemingly observed from first hand experience. The write-ups, while not poorly written, are rather dry and ill-organized. Some interesting points are made. Some illogical conclusions are drawn. The posts date back almost three years.
</p> <p>
An unverified Twitter user claiming to <em>not</em> be the Pro Hero, Hawks (largely believed by the user base and the independent media sources to be the Pro Hero, Hawks) shares the most recent of these posts on an otherwise uneventful Sunday afternoon, a few hours after its initial posting.

Was anyone else watching the late-night interview with the interns from Nighteye's agency because can you even BELIEVE that Lemillion guy??
</p><p>
"My quirk isn't strong, I am!", bull S#!T.
</p><p>
You think you'd get as far as you have if you had mutation quirk that discolored your skin?? NO. YOU FREAKING WOULDN'T HAVE. GOD. I hope no impressionable children were watching your interview, because that sort of mindset is contagious and DAMAGING AF.
</p><p>
As you can likely already tell, this post will be a departure from my usual format. We will be discussing the difference between "versatility" and "strength" and why they're the SAME FREAKING THING.
</p><p>
(IF I EVER SEE YOU IRL: LEMILLION, I WILL PUNCH YOU IN YOUR GOSH DARNED PERFECT PACMAN FACE.)

Hawks, I must ask to speak with you concerning the blog post you shared publicly this afternoon. Please call my office at your earliest convenience.

<span class=init-tw-box-left>Hawks, please. You and I both know that it is.

<span class=init-tw-box-right>who is this "hawks" person never heard of them

<span class="tw-time-right">2:50
<span class=tw-check> ‚úì </span></span>



<span class=init-tw-box-left>I am painfully aware of how data transfer and storage works on services owned by third-parties, so while I would <em>very much appreciate</em> you answering your phone, if I have no other choice then at least I do not wish to have this conversation in front of the obvious public.
</span>
<span class="tw-time-left">2:51

<span class=init-tw-box-right>don't get out much do u

<span class=init-tw-box-left>I don't think you understand the potential gravity of this kind of publicly facing information. The blog post in question publicly disclosed concerningly viable ways of bypassing the quirk belonging to my intern, Lemillion, to accomplish the goal of "punching him in the face". It was phased lightly as if a joke, but the methods are quite possibly sound. I will require more investigation to know for sure. <br/><br/>
Though the content contained on this blog would appear to the untrained eye to be harmless speculation, in the hands someone who would wish harm upon a given hero, these speculations could be weaponized.<br/><br/>
It is possible the author of these posts realizes the potential ramifications of his actions. However, without further proof as to the author's intent, I have no grounds with which to pursue his identity or to enforce that he remove the article on Lemillion. So I ask again;

<span class=init-tw-box-left>You tweeted a direct link to the post not three hours after it was posted. From the average fan base of the site BEFORE 24 hours ago, you were one among the tens of people following this person's blog before you caused them to "go viral", as they say.

<span class=init-tw-box-left>Are you willing and able to assist me in tracking down the owner of this blog? It would appear that there were several posts of a more personal nature that were available to the public previous to this incident. I have only been able to retrieve but a handful.
