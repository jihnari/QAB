On the afternoon of July 23, Inko Midoriya received a total of 20 images containing unsolicited naked images of a certain man. After noticing the first 5 images, she blocked the number. The next 5 came from a new number, which she also blocked. At the third new number sending her inappropriate images, she replied with the following text message.

<blockquote>I don't know who you think this is, but I don't appreciate receiving these pictures. Please stop sending them.</blockquote>

The response to this was immediate, and contained another inappropriate image.

She received 7 additional images while talking to NTT support about getting her number changed. Over dinner, she told her son that the telephone company accidentally gave her number to someone else and sent him a text containing her new number.

A week later, her son takes notice of a suspicious man as he's headed home from his college night classes.

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:23</span><br />
Yeah, I'm fine, really, you don't need to worry about me. I don't even see him anymore, I feel really silly. I'm sorry for wasting your time!

</p>
<hawks_unofficial>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:23</span><br />
not really, I guess? I'm walking to the station, the street is pretty empty.
</p>

<p><b>hawks_unofficial </b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:23</span><br />
is there a 24h conbini nearby? <br/>
maybe a net cafe? anything you could duck into to be seen by other people
</p>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:27</span><br />
I don't see one, but I don't want to miss the last train. <br/>
I was probably just freaking out over nothing.
</p>

<p><b>hawks_unofficial </b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:27</span><br />
when our instincts tell us we're unsafe there's a REASON we feel unsafe <br/>
dont feel bad about your brain telling you there's something wrong <br/>
i'd rather you miss the last train and be safe than... not that <br/>
i can come pick you up, or pay for a cab or smth if thats a problem
</p>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:30</span><br />
I mean, yeah, I just<br/>
I worry a lot anyway? It's kind of a problem. I have meds. I'm sure it was nothing?
</p>

<p><b>hawks_unofficial </b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:30</span><br />
is there even 1% of you that still feels like you're in danger?
</p>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:30</span><br />
Sort of. I guess. But I don't want to cause anyone any trouble.
</p>

<p><b>hawks_unofficial </b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:30</span><br />

</p>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 22:30</span><br />
