<hr/>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Todoroki Shouto discovers QAB while attending classes at U.A. High School in early July. For several days in a row, every time Shouto enters a room, everyone inside goes quiet. At first he thinks he's being oversensitive, then he decides he's not but it doesn't matter. His classmates can gossip all they like, it won't affect his preformance. However, upon noticing the awkward, suspicious silences aren't limited to his peers but in fact extend to the teachers and staff at U.A., Shouto becomes annoyed. 
<br/><br/>
If he's done something wrong, someone should tell him. He can't fix it otherwise. 
<br/><br/>
Another week of this passes before Shouto decides he's done waiting for whatever this is to blow over and takes matters into his own hands. This started with his peers, and that's where Shouto plans to end it.
<br/><br/>
The lunch bell rings. Aizawa-sensei leaves first and clumps of students follow suit in stages. Shouto corners one of the stragglers.
<br/><br/>
"What is everyone talking about?" he asks bluntly.
<br/><br/>
The brown-haired mousy girl whose name Shouto doesn't know looks taken aback. She says, "Uh, talking about? Todoroki-kun, we were just about to go down to the cafeteria. We weren't talking about anything."
<br/><br/>
Shouto narrows his eyes and the girl's own eyes go wide and nervous.
<br/><br/>
"That's not what I mean," he says. "Everyone's been talking behind my back. I want to know what about."
<br/><br/>
Her hands fly up to cover her mouth and she lets out a small, shocked *oh!* "I didn't realize youâ€”I mean, of course itâ€”oh, Todoroki-kun, I'm so sorry, I'll let everyone know right away and we'll stop, I'm sure it must be uncomfortable, I'm so, so sorry."
<br/><br/>
"No," says Shouto, impatient now. "That's not what I asked. I want to know what everyone thinks they can't say around me."
<br/><br/>
"Um," says the girl, visibly sweating. She doesn't continue. Shouto silently stares her down, prepared to outwait her.
<br/><br/>
Another classmate interrupts the stand-off.
<br/><br/>
"Todoroki-kun, did you see that article about Endeavor last week?" the second girl croaks.
<br/><br/>
Shouto breaks his staring contest with the brown-haired girl to face the new speaker. "My father?" Why is he suddenly making an appearence in this conversation? "There's always articles being written about him. I don't make a habit of reading them." 
<br/><br/>
The brown haired girl's hand falls away from her mouth and Shouto glances over to see her expression turn to disbelief.
<br/><br/>
"Well," says the second girl, "there was an unflattering article about Endeavor that was really popular. A lot of people have been talking a lot about it. Maybe they didn't want to bring it up in front of you."
<br/><br/>
Shouto's still not sure that explains anything. "There's a lot of unflattering articles about Endeavor. He doesn't make much of an effort to be media friendly."
<br/><br/>
"Well," says the second girl diplomatically, "maybe you should read it for yourself and see what you think."
<br/><br/>
She writes the name of the blog and the article on a piece of paper for him. He takes it to Yaoyorozu and gets her to teach him how to use the browser feature on his phone.
<br/><br/>
That night after dinner, Shouto reads the allegedly offending article. A strange, bubbling feeling wells up in his chest. He reads the follow-up articles. That night, he forgoes sleep and reads every publicly available post Shuttai has ever written. He reads all of the comments and replies, peruses Twitter posts, absorbs fan theories on Tumblr, discovers fan blogs, and consumes all of the information he can find.
<br/><br/>
It's not enough.
