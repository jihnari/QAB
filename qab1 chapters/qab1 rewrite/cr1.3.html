question: Do you think that by talking about this, we're lending more power to a force that seems to be in opposition to the government? Not trying to troll, just curious from a sociological point of view.

Answer: (tl;dr: QAB posted an article that Endeavor took offence to and issued a lawsuit. The internet (ie., Twitter) has proceeded to take sides/flip its s#!t.)
<br/><br/>
QAB is short for "Quirk Analysis Blog for the Future", the long-winded title of a personal blog hosted by it's sole author, "Shuttai".
<br/><br/>
QAB has been around for a few years but only started seeing popularity when few verified hero accounts on Twitter started publicly debating the content. Around the same time, QAB started to change the way it presented content; it's now publishing current event articles and has also started up a "quirk consultation" series. This seems to have done two things: made QAB controversial, and cemented a die hard fanbase. (As an aside, the quirk consultations are incredibly well done and worth a read, especially for anyone interested in pursuing a career in quirk analysis. Readers vote on a list of submitted quirks and then the writer of QAB posts detailed dissertations on the most popular ones. He's an amateur (amateur as in not classically trained/no accreditation, and he's not shy about admitting that), but the series has been garnering a lot of attention.)
<br/><br/>
Earlier this week QAB posted a more political piece about media coverage in heroics. The post talks about how heroics is turning into a "popularity contest", and turning some heros into "dangerously unstable megalomaniacs [...] like Endeavor." Endeavor's agency very quickly tried to sue on the basis of defamation or libel, but 1, suing an anonymous internet user is no joke, 2, the post isn't against the terms of service for the service provider he uses, and 3, as far as anyone can tell, Endeavor wasn't actually defamed. (Not by any legal definitions, anyway.)
<br/><br/>
There's rumors that a SECOND lawsuit was filed against QAB for how the fanbase reacted to the first lawsuit, but I haven't seen any solid proof of that.
<br/><br/>
Currently, it's a full-blown Twitter war. Even some of my IRL coworkers have strong opinions about what is ultimately one anonymous guy on the internet publicly publishing his political views... just like everyone on Twitter is doing already. Someone with more of a sociology background might be able to tell you why the article has been so polarizing.

QAB is being sued for libel, not slander. Slander is oral, libel is written. (But otherwise, 10/10)

Endeavor's people have been really aggressive about getting in front of any potential bad press ever since he failed to bring down Stain back in May. I think that's part of the reason things got so out of control.

I think people got worked up because ANN keeps running stories about how similar Stain and Shuttai (founder of QAB) are. They do seem to have some similar thoughts on the current state of hero society, but Stain is out on the streets stabbing people and Shuttai is giving away free quirk consultations.

    Hawks response was really enlightening, from the perspective of someone outside of the heroics industry. He seemed to sort of (respectfully) disagree with Shuttai? Considering how much he helped push QAB to where it is today, I would have expected Hawks to either back Shuttai or disavow him entirely.

<p class="blog-header">Concerning the Lawsuit</p>
<p class="blog-date"> by Shuttai on July 05, 20X4 </p>
<p> 
    Hey everyone! I apologize that this isn't the quirk analysis you were expecting. Instead, I wanted to address the recent rumors and set the record straight before things can get even more ridiculous.
<br/><br/><br/>

    <strong>Did Endeavor sue you?</strong><br/>
    Endeavor's <em>publicity team</em> tried to threaten me with a lawsuit. This was done in an effort to intimidate me into removing an article I posted early last week. They believed the article did not frame Endeavor in "an accurate or publicly respectable manner", which I think was their way of accusing me of defamation. (You've probably read the offending post already, given that you're reading this. But in case you missed it, <span class="fake-link">here it is</span>.)
<br/><br/>
    It is my suspicion that Endeavor's publicity team did not, in fact, read the article they tried to sue me over, as the lines they took issue with were taken out of context. The lawsuit (or rather, the empty threat of a lawsuit) has subsequently been dropped.
<br/><br/><br/>

    <strong>Do you have a personal grudge against Endeavor?</strong><br/>
    Endeavor has done a lot for Japan, and many grateful people owe him their lives. Again, if you've <a class="fake-link" href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">read the original post</a>, I think you'll see that my criticisms are against the current structure of the hero industry, NOT directly against Endeavor.
<br/><br/><br/>

    <strong>Regarding Hawks</strong><br/>
    Hawks and I are not fighting, and we don't hate each other. I don't know why people keep asking about this. I don't even know Hawks! To be honest, I'd be too embarrassed to try to talk to him, even over the internet. He's so famous?? He's?? So cool?? I'm pretty sure the one time he allegedly read my blog was just a fluke. I'm sure someone like him is much too busy for the ramblings of an amature quirk enthusiast.
<br/><br/>
    In the off chance his recent tweet wasn't just a mistake or a joke, then I am honored he read my post and I respect his opinion! He's given me a lot to think about. My personal perspective is one from the outside looking in. I, like many of you, live in a world where every decision the Hero Public Safety Commission makes can affect my daily life and well-being, and as such I have opinions about how they operate. But I am in no way a professional in the hero industry.
<br/><br/>
    And on the topic of other's opinions, please keep in mind that everyone is entitled to their own! We are all walking through life using a different lens of upbringing and experience. We all have different opinions and ideas on what we think is the right way to change the world. In the end, I believe the melding of those ideas is what will give us the power to shape our collective future for the better.
