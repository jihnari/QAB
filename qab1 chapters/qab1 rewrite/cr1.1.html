<!-- 
not quite sure how to go about this yet. 
thoughts: 
- use only qab2.css
- failing that, make a qab1.5.css, that adds in the few missing skins (tw dm list, that one formal report header) and removes tumblr oh wait no lol theres a tumblr skin in qab1 
- dont copy from the html files, copy from ao3? then you can have only the text? i like this thought. 
- oh wait the line/sms sections dont need to be rewritten? or if they do, its minimal. i only made small changes, and we dont gave to reflect the 2022 line updates. 
- having to switch "line-box-right" to "line-box-right1" is physically hurting me 
- ok but other than that this is going ok. the information is here, even if its a bit buried. (things like dates/times.) unsure if i did headers for sections originally oh wait the file is right there. ok i DID but i didnt add in dates/who was talking, at least not in the first chapter. not sure when that started. its fine the chapters arent that long. 
- last thought, id like to add more sections? longer sections? idk.
- bare minimum, i update all the code so that it CAN be updated (as is, any edits to anything in qab1 would kill a lot of things. tho it would prooobably be fine if i wrapped everything in a figure. but then id have to update qab1 to include the figure code. idk man, i know thats technically less effort but as long as im changing anything i might as well change everything?) and fix some inconsistancies in the process (himiko comes to mind, so does hawks and his level of annoyingness. (might also make him more chill, he doesnt care what nighteye does and he'd be better at hiding it.) past that idk we'll see?  
- OH HELL THE UBUNTU TERMINAL

  The majority posts on the virtually unknown and largely unpopular personal blog titled "Quirk Analysis Blog for the Future" are lengthy, rambling, nonsensical, and largely impartial dissertations on various quirks. Some of these dissertations are obviously based off of popular heroes of the last decade. Others are seemingly observed from first hand experience. The write-ups, while not poorly written, are rather dry and ill-organized. Some interesting points are made. Some illogical conclusions are drawn. The posts date back almost three years.
  <br/><br/>
  An unverified Twitter user claiming to not be the Pro Hero, Hawks (largely believed by the user base and the independent media sources to be the Pro Hero, Hawks) shares the most recent of these posts on an otherwise uneventful Sunday afternoon, a few hours after its initial posting.

<p class="blog-header">Versatility VS Strength</p>
<p class="blog-date"> by Shuttai on June 2, 20X4  -  3 Comments </p>
<p> 
      Was anyone else watching the late-night interview with the interns from Nighteye's agency because can you even BELIEVE that Lemillion guy??
  <br/><br/>
      "My quirk isn't strong, I am!", bull S#!T.
  <br/><br/>
  
      You think you'd get as far as you have if you had a mutation quirk that changed the color of your fingernails?? NO. YOU FREAKING WOULDN'T HAVE. GOD. I hope no impressionable children were watching your interview, because that sort of mindset is contagious and DAMAGING AF.
  <br/><br/>
  
      As you can likely already tell, this post will be a departure from my usual format. We will be discussing the difference between "versatility" and "strength" and why they're the SAME FREAKING THING.
  <br/><br/>
  
      (IF I EVER SEE YOU IRL: LEMILLION, I WILL PUNCH YOU IN YOUR GOSH DARNED PERFECT PACMAN FACE.)

  Hawks, I must ask to speak with you concerning the blog post you shared publicly this afternoon. Please call my office at your earliest convenience.

  <span class=tw-box-right0>who is ths "hawks" person nvr heard of them

  <span class="tw-time-right">2:50
  <span class=tw-check> ✓ </span></span>
  
  <span class=tw-box-left0>I am painfully aware of how data transfer and storage works on services owned by third-parties, so while I would very much appreciate you answering your phone, if I have no other choice then at least I do not wish to have this conversation in a public setting.
  </span>
  <span class="tw-time-left">2:51

  <span class=tw-box-right0>dont get out much do u

  <span class="tw-time-right">2:53
  <span class=tw-check> ✓ </span></span>
  
  <span class=tw-box-left0>I don't think you understand the potential gravity of this kind of publicly facing information. The blog post in question publicly disclosed concerningly viable ways of bypassing the quirk belonging to my intern, Lemillion, to accomplish the goal of "punching him in the face". It was phased lightly as if a joke, but the methods are quite possibly sound. I will require more investigation to know for sure. 
    <br/><br/>
  Though the content contained on this blog would appear to the untrained eye to be harmless speculation, in the hands someone who would wish harm upon a given hero, these speculations could be weaponized.
  <br/><br/>
  It is possible the author of these posts realizes the potential ramifications of his actions. However, without further proof as to the author's intent, I have no grounds with which to pursue his identity or to enforce that he remove the article on Lemillion. So I ask again;
  </span>

  <span class=tw-box-left0>You tweeted a direct link to the post not three hours after it was posted. From the average fan base of the site BEFORE 24 hours ago, you were one among the tens of people following this person's blog before you caused them to "go viral", as they say.

  <span class=tw-box-left0>Are you willing and able to assist me in tracking down the owner of this blog? It would appear that there were several posts of a more personal nature that were available to the public previous to this incident. I have only been able to retrieve but a handful.

      The hero commission should be alerted about any hero obstructing a case for their own benefit.
