Thanks sandsalot, for your submission! Sandsalot, if a more useful quirk is really important to you, oftentimes you can push your own limitations through hard work and repetition.

  I wish this were a rhetorical question, because: ALL MIGHT. However, there are a number of reasons (personal, professional, or otherwise) why an individual may not, in fact, like All Might. These people range from indifference, to proactive anger towards at All Might for perceived failures in the way the Hero Association [...]

I don't know what you're expecting out of a personal blog? Of course Shuttai posts whatever he wants. I think it's great, if he just posted the same thing all the time I think I would have gotten bored by now. You don't have to like it of course, but it seems like you've never seen a blog before and are just mad about it being the thing that it is.

So we're saying a "grade schooler" can write proficiently about high-level quirk sciences now? I think the content probably just went over your head.

A lot of the posts on this sub aren’t unpopular opinions, they're just people complaining about things they personally don’t like.

  It's so fucking overhyped. There are so many better analyses out there, why is QAB the one to catch on? Just because Hawks tweeted about it the one time? Pathetic.

  Agreed, it's just the Hawks fans. They'll get bored and move on in a few weeks. Especially after the author fired shots at All Might. 
  <br/><img class="rd-vote" src="https://github.com/jihnari/QAB/raw/main/img/rd-vote-reply.jpg">
  
    <span class="rd-vr1"> <span class="rd-small"><strong>5w4nn</strong><span class="rd-gray-text"> 7h </span></span> <br/>
    I'm sure Hawks' influence didn't hurt, but I got recced QAB by a friend who doesn't even like Hawks. I think you're really underestimating the inherent charm of the QAB's style. And sure the posts might not be the most technical sometimes, but they're very easy to understand without feeling like the author is talking down to you. 
<br/><br/>
    Also there were literally no shots fired at All Might, did you even read the post?

      Common requests are for food recommendations, or if any other members are near a particular establishment and can check for lost items. We've also helped get a cat down from a tree, retrieved a child's balloon, and turned a groper into the police!

  Back in May, the well known comedian, Kuse Keiji, sued Sakama Foods for mislabeling their fish wantons ingredients list. The comedian claimed the failure to list fish as one of the ingredients nearly cost him his life. The catch? He's not allergic to fish.

 Not really related to the post but the link to the circuit diagram maker is going to literally save my life. It won't stop my ceng class from kicking my ass but at least now I won't have to draw diagrams by hand.

    The post was great as always. I have a friend with an electricity based quirk and we used to do a lot of experimenting with it when we were kids. I really thought we'd tried it all. Now, I'm thinking about calling him up and seeing if he wants to see if he can make clouds. Then again, you have a scarily good point about cloud seeding and the dangers thereof. 
    <br/><br/>
    It also makes sense that any quirk dealing with electricity would rely on the user's bio-electricity for conversion, but since people are bio-matter I wonder if there would be merit in testing a given user's electrolyte levels and seeing what effects that has on quirk output, etc.

    I've been thinking about electrolyte levels as well! I would have liked to include something about that in this post but I didn't have the time to do proper research into it. I did pull together a bunch of white papers that seem promising. Hopefully I can work that into a future write-up!
