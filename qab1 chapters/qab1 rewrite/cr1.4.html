These people range from indifference, to proactive anger towards at All Might for perceived failures in the way the Hero Association [...]

  Common requests are for food recommendations, or if any other members are near a particular establishment and can check for lost items. We've also helped get a cat down from a tree, retrieved a child's balloon, and turned a groper into the police!
