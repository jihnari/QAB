  As there was no confirmed quirk usage involved there are no legal grounds for my agency to get involved.

  However. If we were to receive outside information, such as a tip, from a reliable source, such as a Pro Hero...
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  I think you see where I'm going with this.

  If you think acting ignorant will save you or that it can somehow ease the culpability you bear, you are sorely mistaken.

On the afternoon of July 23, 20X4, Inko Midoriya received a total of thirty images containing unsolicited naked images of a certain man. After seeing the pictures were indecent in nature, she blocked the number. The same day, she recieved more images of the same kind from a different number, which she also blocked. At the third new number sending her inappropriate images, she replied with the following text message:
<br/><br/>
<p class="sms-box-right">I don't know who you think this is, but I don't appreciate receiving these pictures. Please stop sending them.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<br/>
The response to this was immediate, and contained another inappropriate image.
<br/><br/>
She received seven additional images while talking to NTT support about getting her number changed. Over dinner, she told her son that she'd been getting a lot of spam messages and sent him a text containing her new number. Her son has the brief, guilty thought, <em>I wonder if it's because of that website info thing Koichi told me about?</em> but quickly forgets about it. 
<br/><br/>
A week later, Midoriya Izuku takes notice of a suspicious man as he's headed home from his college night classes.
