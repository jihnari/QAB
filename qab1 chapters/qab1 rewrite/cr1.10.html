He did however, state "The student in question has returned to us [...] energetic and unharmed. He will, of course, be put through a two month mandatory counseling for this traumatic experience."

    'Crawler'? No no, it was definitely 'Hauler'. I dunno if you could even call him a vigilante, he mostly just helped people haul things around, you know, like his name. That was his quirk, to help haul things faster.

<br/><br/>
    What do you mean, 'that's not a quirk', of course it is, I saw it with my own two eyes! He helped me move into my apartment what was it, five years ago now? I hadn't seen him around recently so I thought he'd retired and gotten a real job.

    He looked fine, same costume. Fit him a little less well, because that dude has been working out! He was hella tight, man, bless my eyes."

<p class="blog-header">UA Student Housing Proposal Denied</p>
<p class="blog-date"> by Kuwahara Chieko - August 18, 2X04 </p>
<p>
Voters in the UA Community School District rejected a ballot proposal for on-campus student housing in a special election held on Wednesday. Votes for measure approval fell 20.5 percent short of the simple majority needed.
<br/><br/>
The failure of this measure to pass is largely attributed to UAs overall failure to secure their own campus and assure the safety of their students and staff during off-campus activities. A second vote will be taken in December. If approved, students currently attending UA would be required to use the new boarding system in order to remain enrolled. 
<br/><br/>
According to various third party reports, the Principal of UA High is still persuing construction companies for quites on a lange scale addition to the school campus, but declined for comment. Though there is speculation that UA plans to continue pushing for dormitory housing, these construction inqueries could also be related to the USJ building, which has been operating at a 50% capacity since the League of Villains attack in April of this year.

      I've been looking for other blogs like QAB and ran into Prelude. Does this sub have an opinion?
      <br/><br/>
      His content looks super promising, especially the quirk studies stuff. But one of my big hang ups is that I prefer text articles so I can read on the train and on breaks at work, and he seems to be most active on youtube.

There's a lot of QAB clones out there, but in my opinion Prelude is next level. His takes are unique and his analyses are solid. I hear you on the video vs written content though.

  Thank you for accepting my friend request.

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:38</span><br /> 
  I apologize for contacting you directly, but I wanted to thank you personally for your part in helping my classmate. Though he may not appreciate or acknowledge it, we may very well have saved his life. Because of the community you fostered, because you taught people to help out where they can and stand up for themselves, because you stepped up and took charge of the mission itself, we were able to remove someone from a dangerous situation. We absolutely couldn't have done it without you. <br/>
  And because the student in question would be too prideful to say it, I'll say it for him. <br/>
  Thank you.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:50</span><br /> 
  I like to think it all would have worked out somehow but I'm incredibly glad I could help! <br/>
  I couldn't just ignore someone in need if there was a chance we could do something. I'm so glad it worked out and that your classmate is back home safe.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:57</span><br /> 
  None the less <br/>
  Thank you again, Shuttai-san. You're a true hero.
