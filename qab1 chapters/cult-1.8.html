Hey this is Hawks (clears throat) like for real Hawks this time, not some drunk dude calling in pretending to be Hawks as a prank and not for real Hawks calling in as a prank either, I swear.

What? Why? That's definitely not your jurisdiction.

<p class=row> <span class="interview in_name">  HK  </span><span class="interview in_text">
I would have an incredibly difficult time explaining that, it was kind of an emergency but listen, all I need is to get Chiba PD involved so they can escort this extremely not nice man to jail. Also if it uh wouldn't be too much trouble could you maybe check for other heroes in the area who could come babysit the perp? I can't stick around.

"Who are you? If this is about the USJ incident again, I'd like to remind you—"

"No no, we're an independent media outlet, we try to cover things not currently being observed by the mainstream media."

"I don't know what you think that means."

"Are you aware of the 'Quirk Analysis Blog' run by Shuttai?"

"Yes, that's the one."

"Then yes, I'm aware."

"Are you also aware that before QAB's big boom he published a series of dissertations on different quirks?"

"I'll admit, I'm a bit behind on pop culture, and I don't follow the blog myself."

"Oh, uh. Um, would you mind if we read that article to you? There's a lot of interest in who the original subjects were, especially for the first six months of the blog's existence back in 20X0. It is strongly suspected that you were one of the targets of these early works."

<span class="name-header">Looking for tips to deal with elevated anxiety </span><br/>
<p>
I had a close call with a villain just over a week ago. In the end it was fine, nothing really happened. The hero even escorted me home. I was fine the first day, but ever since then I can't stop thinking about "what if". I should have known it was coming, I should have reacted faster, been less stupid, but I wasn't and it turned out fine anyway. But what if it hadn't? What if that hero hadn't been there?

I've always been a kind of anxious person, but never like this. I can't eat, I can't sleep, My chest hurts, and I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack. Is there anything I can do to stop feeling like this? None of my normal coping techniques are working.

If you don't mind me asking, it might help to get some more context on the incident?

Don't at all feel like you have to answer this, though. Villains do bad things all the time, and you can't blame yourself for what you can't control.

I maybe should have put more info in my original post, but I didn't know how to put it into words and not feel pathetic.

I have a bit of an (anonymous) online presence, but I guess I wasn't so careful after all because the guy who came after me figured out who I was in real life and he had been following me around for at least a few days. I kept seeing him hanging out in front of my school, but I didn't think anything of it even when he gave me the creeps. <br/><br/>
<span class="vr1"><strong>Mousegirl27 </strong> <span class="slightly-weak"> 5 points · 1 day ago</span> <br/>Hey, sorry to hijack, but I went through something very similar a few years back. I was stalked for almost 6 months and spend most of that time telling myself it was all in my head. Some really bad things happened because of it, and I spent a long time thinking that if only I had noticed or behaved differently or talked to someone sooner, I could have prevented it. I felt like it was it was my fault. It wasn't. This isn't your fault. <br/><br/>The best thing I could do for myself was accept that it happened, that it sucked, try to learn from the experience, and to move on. Don't feel bad if you can't move on right away, it took me over a year to get past the worst of it.  </span></p></div>

Hey, sorry you're going through this. I find “<a href="https://imgur.com/0N53Gah">box breathing</a>” to be particularly helpful when nothing else seems to calm me down.
<ol type="1">
<li> Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). </li>
<li> Hold the breath for a count to 4 </li>
<li> Exhale for a count to 4 </li>
<li> Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4. </li>
</ol>
Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.<br/>
<p class="vr1"><strong>MoMoDragon </strong> <span class="slightly-weak"> 1 point · 2 days ago </span> <br/>It takes a few minutes, but this helps me as well. </span>

Last Sunday, the feared Hero Killer: Stain attacked a top ranking hero in broad daylight. Witnesses say it was a harrowing experience, but we talked to the hero in question in an EXCLUSIVE interview. The Wing Hero: Hawks, famous for his unbeatable speeds and his spotless rescue record, says the encounter wasn't "[...] that big of a deal.
