<!-- +interview 8/17-->

[Excerpt from interview with Yamasaki Amaya on 8/17/20X4 relating to a possible link between the "Kamino Explosion" and "Bakugou Katsuki" cases. Interviewer's comments cut for brevity.]<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="lazy-interview">

"That's right. Yeah, Hauler was there. You know, that vigilante kid from a while back? How far back? I dunno.

...

<em>'Crawler'</em>? No no, it was definitely 'Hauler'. I dunno if you could even call him a vigilante, he mostly just helped people haul things around, you know, like his name. That was his quirk, to help haul things faster.

...

What do you mean, 'that's not a quirk', of course it is, I saw it with my own two eyes! He helped me move into my apartment what was it, five years ago now? I hadn't seen him around recently so I thought he'd retired and gotten a real job.

...

He looked fine, same costume. Fit him a little less well, because that dude has been working <em>out!</em>  He was hella tight, man, bless my eyes."

<span class="weakish">by <b>Kuwahara Chieko
</b><br/>
August 18, 2X04</span></p>
<div class="fadeout"><p>
Voters in the UA Community School District rejected a ballot proposal for on-campus student housing in a special election held on Wednesday.
</p><p>
Votes for measure approval fell 20.5 percent short of the simple majority needed.
</p><p>
If approved, the students currently attending UA would be required to use the new boarding system in order to remain enrolled. The failure of this measure to pass is largely attributed to UAs overall failure to secure their own campus and assure the safety of their students and staff during off-campus activities. A second vote will be taken in December

Thank you for accepting my friend request.

</p>
<p><b>Shouto</b> <span class="weak">Today at 12:38</span><br />
I apologize for contacting you directly, but I wanted to thank you personally for your part in helping my classmate. Though he may not appreciate or acknowledge it, we may very well have saved his life. Because of the community you fostered, because you taught people to help out where they can and stand up for themselves, because you stepped up and took charge of the mission itself, we were able to remove someone from a dangerous situation. We absolutely couldn't have done it without you.
<br/>And because the student in question would be too prideful to say it, I'll say it for him.
<br/>Thank you.
</p>

<p><b>Shuttai</b> <span class="weak">Today at 12:50</span><br />
I like to think it all would have worked out somehow but I'm incredibly glad I could help!
<br/>I couldn't just ignore someone in need if there was a chance we could do something. I'm so glad it worked out and that your classmate is back home safe.
</p>
<Shuttai>

<p><b>Shouto</b> <span class="weak">Today at 12:57</span><br />
None the less
<br/>Thank you again, Shuttai-san. You're a true hero.
