Hello, Shuttai-san.

I feel kind of weird sending this email, but I just thought you should know that the whois for your blog domain has this Gmail account? It also seems to have your real name, possibly? Don't worry, I didn't look you up or anything! I just thought you might like to know, and also to remove that information before you get any more popular and more people start looking at that sort of stuff.

My deepest apologies for um, stalking you,

What is a whois?? how did you get this email?? Are you saying other people can get this email and my real name??

Yes, that is unfortunately what I'm saying. Do you remember setting up the domain for your blog? When you register a domain, you also have to provide contact information for that domain. It's not uncommon for people to use their real information for this contact information, but it is accessible to anyone who knows where to look.

This is probably going to sound really creepy, but is xxx-xxx-xxx still your number? That's also included on the whois for your domain.

This might not make you feel better, but I promise, I'm just a normal college student. I do computers as a hobby, and follow Hawks' Twitter. I swear I didn't look you up, but if you're underage that makes this all the more important.

If you call me, I can help you take this information offline.

My number:
+81 xxx-xxx-xxx

I hadn't, thanks for bringing this to my attention, anon!  I can sort of see where people are coming from with #10 but after looking it over I just don't think the theory "QAB #13 is Bubble Girl" holds any water.

He's not accounting for the kilojoules lost during the exothermic part of the reaction, but the idea is solid. I'd assume he over-simplified it for his readers, seems legit to me.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Approximately one month after hawks_unofficial initial viral post, the blog titled "Quirk Analysis Blog for the Future" (otherwise known as "Q. A. B.") has gone from an average of 10 views per post to an average of 20,000 views per post.</p>

<p>Midoriya Izuku does not know how to view the impressions analytics for his suddenly popular blog, and only notices that sometimes, people actually comment on his posts now. Even the older posts he wrote, quote, "[...] all the way back in middle school!" </p>

<p>He thinks this is, quote, "Pretty neat!" and "Kinda exciting!" but that "[...] nah, I don't think it's something I could see myself doing long-term, I still wanna be a doctor, y'know? It's just for fun until I'm too busy!" </p>

<p>He says these things to his mother over dinner. He does not google himself or his moniker, "Shuttai" (an alternate reading of the name "Izuku" that Izuku discovered when he was 10), and thus does not see the rise in online articles and speculation. He is unaware that the "kyuu-ei-bee" he begins to hear about in passing refers to his own blog. He does not have a Twitter account. </p>

<p>At the time, Midoriya Izuku is 15 years old.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
