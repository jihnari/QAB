  Actually, no, what the hell  <br/>
  Why were they letting a 15 yo fight against a guy makes KNIVES WITH HIS BODY <br/>
  and WITHOUT BACKUP  <br/>
  where the hell was his backup, I don't understand  <br/>
  And that guy?? it's not like I can prove anything but I did a deep dive and I'm like 90% sure he's with the yakuza which Fatgum WOULD HAVE KNOWN. So, what, he's just letting his 15 year old intern fight against the yakuza?? Is that what heroics is now??  <br/>
  There's this huge social/societal pressure for heroes to be able to fight on their own, to do everything themselves, to the point where it's like we're not treating them like they're human anymore. And that's a problem!!  <br/>
  People have limits! People need help! And for the love of god FIFTEEN YEAR OLD INTERNS SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING MEN WHO TURN INTO KNIVES BY THEMSELVES  <br/>
  Can you even imagine how badly this could have turned out if Red Riot's quirk wasn't what it was??
</p>


  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:12</span><br />
  Maybe Fatgum accounted for that? He knew Red Riot's quirk and understood his limits and decided he could handle it.
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:12</span><br />
  And that makes it okay for a 15 year old intern to not have backup???  <br/>
  Sorry, that came out wrong I'm just so mad about this  <br/>
  Also sorry I'm ranting to you about it I know you didn't sign up for this, I can stop
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:12</span><br />
    Don't apologize, I like seeing your thought process.  <br/>
    It's very interesting
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:12</span><br />
  You're so nice to me ü•∫ <br/>
  But seriously, if I end up annoying you just let me know and I can back off!!
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />
    I can promise you that won't happen.
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />
    Are you going to do a blog post on this topic? It sounds like you're fired up enough about it.
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />
    It's definitely something I'm passionate about, but it doesn't feel that simple anymore
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />
    How so?
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:13</span><br />
    The response I get from talking about issues like this is just <em>different</em>. Like. Okay.  <br/>
  So you know how I did that piece on UA a while back? I got LITERAL DEATH THREATS, a hoard of angry emails, and one super weird guy pretending to be a lawyer to try and sue me. I don't want to downplay the importance of that article, I think it generated a lot of important dialogue! And maybe it's my fault for making the title too click-bait-y but a bunch of people leaving angry comments didn't even read the article, they just saw the title and went off. Idk if I want to deal with that again.  <br/>
  Every time I do anything "political" people just get so nasty
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:15</span><br />
    I think that's fair.  <br/>
  But I also think you've made a lot of good points, and that an equally good dialogue could stem from an article about it.
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:15</span><br />
    Yeah... Yeah. I'll think about it.
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:15</span><br />
    :)

  <p class="blog-header">The Culpability of Heroes</p>
  <p class="blog-date"> by Shuttai on September 16, 20X4  -  403 Comments </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  Earlier this week, a video of a hero intern fighting a villain was uploaded to the internet and went viral overnight. Thousands of people‚Äîfans, reporters, members of the hero community‚Äîare praising this young man for his quick thinking and his willingness to put himself in the line of fire to protect civilians.

  You know what they're not talking about? They're not talking about how this "intern" is 15 years old, how this 15 year old had been working at Fat Gum's agency for less than a week, or how this 15 year old, during his first ever internship at a hero agency, was sent to pursue a dangerous perpetrator <em>by himself</em>, without backup.

  This is not a criticism of the intern in question, though I am fully convinced that had he let the perpetrator flee, the situation wouldn't have escalated. But that shouldn't have been his call to make.

  I'll say it again: a 15 year old with less than a week's worth of agency experience engaged in solo, un-aided combat with an armed perpetrator.

  The fact that the video exists at all is a huge red flag. Because do you know what that means? Do you know what it means that there were multiple angles of this fight on the compilation videos continuously being uploaded and shared on YouTube and Twitter?

  It means there was a whole group of people standing just behind this fight <em>filming it</em>, watching a single 15 year old struggle to fight a violent, desperate criminal, a man so desperate that he took the illegal quirk-enhancing drug Trigger in the middle of the fight‚Äîand still, the bystanders stood and watched. They didn't call for help. They didn't step in.

  Their only involvement was to block the exit, actively aggravating the perpetrator and making it harder for the rookie pro hero to fight, because he had to fight with their safety in mind. (See <a>this video</a> at 5:32 to see what I'm talking about.)

  A group of fully grown adults (see interviews from the witnesses <a>here</a> and <a>here</a>) sat and watched as a <em>15 year old</em> fought an armed adult. And then they uploaded it to YouTube.

  I'll save the discussion for why this bystander effect is so prevalent in our society and how recent quirk usage laws are only exasperating the issue for another day, but for now, I just want everyone to leave here with this thought:

  Would you stand back filming while a 15yo got stabbed in the streets?



  (And to Red Riot, if you happen to ever read this; capturing a villain isn't worth your life. Please take care of yourself.)
