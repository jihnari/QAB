    Are you aware that one of your students was involved in the QCon riot this weekend?
  </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="sms-time">09:46</p>

  <span class="sms-box-right">
    I find "was involved in a riot" a funny way to phrase "helped de-escalate the situation".
  </span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  But I had heard, yes.
</span>


<span class="sms-box-left">
  He was involved in an official capacity without the proper licensing, which is issue enough.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I simply find it suspicious that two of your students have been recently involved in incidents related to QAB.
</span>


<span class="sms-box-right">
  Regarding Kaminari, I appreciate the heads up. I performed my own investigation and did not find anything of note.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  You simply believe both incidents to be coincidental?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Yes.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Your students are likely mixed up in something much bigger than they can handle. QAB is a dangerous organization and I advise you to take this threat seriously.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  And if they are found to be participating in illegal acts, I assure you their transgressions will not be taken lightly.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I would like to remind you that you're talking about one teenager who you questioned without the presence of a lawyer and were unable to press any charges against, and another who helped quell a riot.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Excuse me if I'm not taking your conspiracy theories seriously.

Many individuals were injured during the chaos yesterday at the convention known as QCon. One such individual has released a statement saying that he intends to sue QCon and the Hero Public Safety Committee for negligence and excessive brutality. Representatives at Ito & Nakamura Law Firm are urging members of the public to come forwards with statements to file a class action lawsuit against QCon and the HPSC.

we took second in the competition!!!
<br/>
ngl i did think for a minute we might be able to take first place but second is already a LOT further than we were expecting
<br/>
kinda sad im not an official member but i do not have time for a club this intensive
<br/>
we're heading back early tomorrow morning
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:16</span><br />
But you had fun?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:17</span><br />
yeah i had a blast
<br/>
i really am sorry about how qcon turned out for you tho
<br/>
i feel like i should have been there
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:19</span><br />
It's not your fault even a little bit. And everything turned out fine in the end!
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20</span><br />
i sort of feel like maybe it kind of is, tho?
<br/>
*my fault
<br/>
like, <em>im</em> the one who's been fighting with prelude on twitter, im a big reason things kept escalating, and knew he was an asshole but i didn't think he was an asshole with the power to affect the real world like he obviously has
<br/>
i should have been a lot more careful
<br/>
esp bc you and engineman kept telling me to knock it off and be the bigger man and walk away and i just kept not doing that
<br/>
and maybe if i had things wouldn't have turned out this way
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:22</span><br />
Literally none of that is your fault. You couldn't have known how far he would take things and even if you had, you're not responsible for his fanbase and the protest and the riot. He was going to be an asshole online with or without you
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:22</span><br />
yeah. idk. maybe youre right
<br/>
i just can't help but feel like i could have changed things
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:24</span><br />
Maybe you could have and maybe you couldn't have. What matters is what we do about it now
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
idk what to even do about it now
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
I do :)
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
should i be worried
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
No :)
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
my worry has intensified
</p>

<p class="blog-header">QCon</p>

<p>
  A few days before QCon, I drafted a post about what the convention was trying to do and why, and why the world right now needs people who will speak up about the unfair inequalities of our so-called modern world, free from the problems that plagued us in the past. But I was going to wait until after the event to post anything. I wanted to see how QCon would be received by the attendees and the public, and if that would change my opinion.
  <br/><br/>
  I had heard about the planned protest, but I honestly hadn't given it much thought. It seemed bullheaded and backwards that anyone would be so blatantly anti-mutant quirk in this day and age, especially under the thin guise of "protecting quirkless people". If they were interested in "protecting" quirkless people, why weren't they advocating to remove the "quirk type" field from job applications, or working to raise awareness of the depressingly high rates of suicide among those diagnosed as quirkless? If they were honestly interested in helping, why weren't they involved in QCon?
  <br/><br/>
  I knew they weren't protesting for an honest cause, but I never expected things to turn violent. I don't think any of us did.
  <br/><br/>
  There's a lot of blame being directed to a lot of different places, but we're not here to discuss QCon staff or attendees or protesters. No, we're here to talk about how this happened in the first place.
  <br/><br/>
  We're here to talk about Prelude.
  <br/><br/>
  For months, I've avoided giving my personal opinion in Prelude because I considered it unwarranted and unprofessional. We're both creators and citizens of the internet, and he'd never done anything to me, personally. Given the recent events, I no longer feel obligated to keep my opinion to myself, so here it is:
  <br/><br/>
  Prelude is an irresponsible asshole.
  <br/><br/>
  He has a large following on both YouTube and Twitter, and it is my belief that things Prelude said to his public audience directly caused them to organize the protest at QCon. There are people who would disagree with that claim, and sure, that's my opinion. I don't have proof. But it's a matter of FACT is that Prelude has said nothing about this behavior. By not saying anything, he's implicitly condoning it. His followers think he's on their side; and maybe he is. Maybe he really is that much of an asshole.
  <br/><br/>
  Innocent people got hurt at QCon. Prelude has a responsibility to speak up and put a stop to his follower's behavior, because innocent people will continue to get hurt unless he does.
  <br/><br/>
  And if he continues to enable his followers, then maybe we also have a responsibility. A responsibility to stop him.
