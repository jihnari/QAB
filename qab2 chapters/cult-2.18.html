Despite our best efforts, those at Qcon have refused to heed the dangers of their actions. This is a huge disrespect to not only us, but to the impressionable youths that plan to attend tomorrow. Are we really going to stand by and let this happen?

We know a lot of you are planning to go to QCon and we hope you all have a great time. However, we also hope you'll take the proper precautions to stay safe: be aware of your surroundings, stay in public areas, make sure your phone is charged, etc. And stay hydrated!
<br/><br/>
There have been rumors that a certain group is planning a protest outside the convention center. There's no way to tell if protestors will actually show up, but the QCon organizers are aware and are prepared for this behavior: <br/>
<span class=dc-link>https://twitter.com/QCon/status/1557106614670610331?t=QQUkf6hsc43XHuuekvD5Jg&s=19</span>
<br/><br/>
If you run into anything concerning or even that you're unsure about, <span class=dc-link>#curry</span> is always full of people willing to help. Remember, QCon staff will also be there to make sure the convention stays a safe place for everyone; you can always approach them if you have questions or need help with anything.
<br/><br/>
Have a great weekend everyone!
