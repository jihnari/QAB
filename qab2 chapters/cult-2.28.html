  I feel you op, between Fat Gum's suspension, All Might's fumbling, and the sheer incompetency over at the HPSC, it's hard to have faith that it'll work itself out.

  Isn't the average retirement age for heroes like 35? All Might is already 49, I'm honestly surprised he's still at it

  The HPSC is what's really making me worry. Their recent decisions have been baffling and incompetent. I can't decide if it's better or worse that everyone seems to know it, too. Because on the one hand, at least we're acknowledging the problem. But on the other, "we" includes villains.

  That fire in Ikebukuro last week has me shook up. All Might was smiling but it definitely looked pained in a way it never did before. Dude was literally on fire.

  I know what you're talking about but I'm not so sure that smoke was from the fire. Did you see videos from the Akihabara shoot-out before they got taken down? He was smoking there too, and no fire.

    No, didn't see those videos but heard he almost dropped someone. If there was no fire then what was he smoking from?

<p>
  yeah maybe it's fine
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:09</span><br /> 
  okay actually  <br/>
  some need to worry? sorry, idk how much to tell you, like what do you need to know and what would just freak you out <br/>
  and you shouldn't have to deal with this nonsense but ugghhh you're too freaking public and mysterious and people just won't leave it alone <br/>
  okay  <br/>
  okay so  <br/>
  you're not even online right now, is it better to dump it now or to call you? ugh morality  <br/>
  alright here it is, i have reason to believe that someone is going to break into your email soon and look for info that could lead them to who you are  <br/>
  and i know that's scary but just know im doing everything i can to prevent it and everyone's on your side and we'll get through this <br/>
  but as far as i can tell, even if they DO get your email records there's nothing that points back to you, and nothing criminal. which is good! and i don't think they'll go as far as to request the old email that was attached to the blog like, they wouldn't even know to do that so it's probably fine and im just worried over nothing! and even if they did pull those records there's STILL nothing illegal in there. but they have no right to your personal information and im just trying to make sure they don't get it 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:21</span><br /> 
  but even if they did it would probably be fine is what im saying!  <br/>
  ok ill stop spamming you now hope you're having a good day, please don't let this freak you out too much 
</p>
  
<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:45</span><br />

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:46</span><br /> 
  uh are you okay 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:47</span><br /> 
  I know I should probably be freaked out about this but I'm just not  <br/>
  I just  <br/>
  Today was a day 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:47</span><br /> 
  do you want to talk about it  <br/>
  you were meeting with shouto today weren't you? i thought you guys got along?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:48</span><br /> 
  We did  <br/>
  Do  <br/>
  Assuming he still wants to hang out with me after this 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:48</span><br /> 
  why wouldn't he? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:50</span><br /> 
  The worst and most insane thing that could have happened, happened  <br/>
  Sorry I ghosted you for a bit, I had to turn off my phone <br/>
  I don't even know where to start  <br/>
  I think I'm going to take a nap 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:51</span><br /> 
  that might be a good idea  <br/>
