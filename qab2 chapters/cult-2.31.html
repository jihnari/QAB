  </p>
  <p class=news-border>
Little is known about the major operation Ryukyu carried out two days ago, allegedly with terrorist assistance. This comes as a shock to many, given the Pro Hero's spotless record. "We aren't looking to punish innocent people," said Mera Yokumiru at the press conference held yesterday afternoon. "[Ryukyu] may have been unaware of the illegal ties the group has, and that is precisely what the investigation will find out."

    Early this morning, a few hundred police officers were dispatched to the Central Common Government Office in Kasugameki, expecting to be met with a similar number of protestors. Instead, by 10 AM, the officers were outnumbered two to one. "And they keep coming," says Kajiwara Yasushi, a cashier at a nearby 711. "This is insane. This is Tokyo, why aren't they protesting in Osaka?" A large number of protestors have also gathered at Nanko Cosmo Square in Osaka.

      All Might was spotted in Shinagawa this morning thwarting a robbery, walking several old ladies across the street, and signing several autographs. Except for major incidents, this is the longest consecutive time All Might has been seen in public since April of this year, when he attended a charity event for children with leukemia. Though his decrease in public appearances is to be expected, given that he began teaching at UA earlier this year, it's a welcome

  Himi-chan says that means we're winning

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Do you have a moment 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  What kind of moment 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I think Midoriya is a secret vigilante 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Oh boy
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  That kind of moment 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Who's Midoriya again? 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  When I went to that convention, he was one of the people I went with 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Oh yeah Crawler-san's friend
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Yes
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Okay I'll bite 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Why is this Midoriya guy a vigilante 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  For how much he talks, he largely avoids sharing personal information. I asked him what his hobbies are and he froze up. He often seems tired or talks about having not gotten much sleep, but he says he doesn't have insomnia, and a lot of vigilantes patrol after nightfall. I also asked him if he ever read QAB and he laughed and told me he'd never heard of it, but he seemed to know who Shuttai was, so it would seem like he was lying. He might have been trying to avoid being associated with Shuttai's more government critical views. During the riot at the convention, he also handled himself with the kind of poise and forethought that I wouldn't expect of an untrained civilian. Not to mention, he's friends with Crawler, who all but runs a vigilante ring.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  A LEGAL vigilante ring 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Barely. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Finally, he's childhood friends with Bakugou and Bakugou mentioned he was hiding a secret involving a "different name". What if that different name was his vigilante name, and he was using something from their shared past? 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Idk if it's just because I haven't met this dude but you're kind of selling this one 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I don't actually know what else it could be 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Exactly.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Should I try to introduce him to Aizawa? Maybe Aizawa could help him go legal, or get involved with underground heroics. 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  You just met this dude though, right? And you have to admit, you jump to conclusions sometimes 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Name one of my conclusions that has been wrong. 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I can name five just off the top of my head, but how about the time you thought Lunch Rush and Satou were related
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Who's to say they aren't?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Satou. Satou literally said they aren't. 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  He could be lying. Maybe he finds it awkward to go to the same school as a relative. It could be seen as nepotism. 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Omfg 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Okay fine, the time you were convinced Midnight-sensei was married 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  :/ 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  That tabloid was very convincing 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  All I'm saying is maybe wait a few weeks before getting Aizawa involved, get some more proof, idk 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Well. Fine. If he's as skilled as I suspect, a few more weeks won't hurt. 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Phew 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Okay gtg the police are yelling something I think they're trying to get us to move again

  Remember to not get arrested this time

  Sorry to bother you again but I wanted to know if you know anything about the protest?? <br/>
  I had my phone off all afternoon but then when I finally turned it on after school I had like three separate messages telling me to not look at the server and also to not check twitter and also not look at the news so obviously I did all of those things and I don't know what's going on but it sounds really really bad???? <br/>
  But none of those three people are answering their messages and I don't know what to do 
</p>
