  Fatgum was irresponsible and negligent of minors under his care, and that's a hill I'm prepared to die on, but he is NOT the only problem. As a fun exercise, let's talk about intern injury rates for the last decade:

  The last post I made (not linking it or saying its name to try and avoid the spam bots) was controversial to say the least. Let me tell you why I'm not going to apologize for it.

  Regarding this being rookie's <em>second</em> internship instead of his first: okay. So he has two weeks of on-the-job experience instead of one. Great.

  Earlier this week, a video of a hero intern fighting a villain was uploaded to the internet and went viral overnight. Thousands of people—fans, reporters, members of the hero community—are praising this young man for his quick thinking and his willingness to put himself in the line of fire to protect civilians.

  You know what they're not talking about?

  Sorry I've been neglecting this series! I've had a lot going on lately. Today we're discussing a quirk that allows the user to tell the pH balance of any substance just by touching it.

  This is a lot cooler than it sounds! There's relatively minor uses such as using it for hydroponic gardening, but a quirk like that could have an enormous impact in the field of environmental conservation

At long last, what we all feared has finally come to pass: The mintchoco chips at Lawson have been removed from the shelves. It's been a good run, and I hope to see them next year, and if anyone even tries to tell me all the pumpkin flavor food items infecting the stores right now will "more than make up for it", I will find you and fight you, personally.

    A few weeks ago during one of the "curry missions that didn't happen", a yakuza member got arrested. Given the area (which I am told, for legal reasons, I have never been to) I believe he was Hassaikai.

    Stain was last seen in Erukkido, which is known Hassaikai territory, and is a known supporter of QAB. True, he's been there for a while, but a few days ago an article came out (<a>https://news.yahoo.co.jp/pickup/6426624</a>) and I believe the unnamed inmate was the same one arrested. And then Stain goes missing? The timing is too coincidental.

The ongoing saga of Stain the Hero Killer has captivated the country over the past months, and his sudden disappearance is alarming to say the least. The HPSC says there's no need to worry. "This goes to show the influence of increased patrols and hero presence can have in marginalized areas. The fight against crime is merely the act of making crime not worth the risk."
