  I know better than anyone how capable you are, but you didn't handle that alone and you don't have to handle this alone either. You have people you can rely on.

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:12</span><br />
The blog post. <br/>
I know you were worried about posting it. <br/>
I think it was really well written, by the way.  <br/>
You've given me a lot to think about.

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:13</span><br />
Thank you!!!!  <br/>
Honestly I haven't looked at it since posting it?? I hit upload, turned off email notifications, and went to bed <br/>
Are people mad

I don't know <br/>
Do you want me to read the comments for you?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br />
Nah <br/>
If they're mad, they're mad ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø <br/>
It's just the internet <br/>
I decided I've got better things to do than stress about other people's opinions
