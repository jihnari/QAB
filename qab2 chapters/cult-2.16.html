QCon is notably "for everyone" and "not affiliated with QAB" but it's no secret that a large number of QAB members plan on attending. You really think it's a coincidence that a majority of the panels directly mirror topics Shuttai has discussed on his blog?

okay so you might be making a bigger deal out of this than it is, but basically i wanted to know if anyone's free this weekend to go with my irl friend to a convention
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto | some sheep supremacy</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
Your friend can't just go by himself?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | hungry IS me</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
SHOU. <br/>

P L E A S E .
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto | some sheep supremacy</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
?<br/>
Please what
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-blue">crawler | moon crimes</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:05</span><br />
  haha yeah it's kind of a weird request, right? <br/>
the thing is, he's already got someone going with him but the convention they're going to is quirkless con
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | hungry IS me</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
Ooohhhh crap <br/>
Yeah, that's looking dodgy
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-red">EngineMan | crispy air</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
I'm afraid I don't follow? <br/>
It's just a convention for quirkless people isn't it? <br/>
I know a number of the server members are planning on going
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-blue">crawler | moon crimes</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:05</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | hungry IS me</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-blue">crawler | moon crimes</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:05</span><br />
  """joking""" 🙃
  <br/><span class="dc-emotebox">🙃 2</span><br/>
anyway my friend has really been looking forward to going and there's a large chance nothing will happen bc it's just a bunch of trolls on twitter talking out their ass, but i dont really want to take that chance<br/>
esp since the other friend going with him might have to leave early
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-red">EngineMan | crispy air</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 12:06</span><br />
I do think it's likely you're being unnecessarily cautious, but we can hardly fault you for that.

No, I'd rather have a valid reason to get out of the house for a day. My father's been breathing down my neck the last few weeks, and Rai keeps ditching me to hang out with his "girlfriend"

  Didn't you tell me you were gonna take a JR line too? We were gonna meet up at that gate, remember
</span><span class="line-time-left">16:44
</span>

<span class="line-box-right1">
  Right but I was thinking JR might be a little busy so I might take metro instead since that's usually emptier on weekend mornings you know? haha

</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:45</span><br />
FIRST you DITCH me, and THEN you say "I'll get some friends to go with you so you wont have to go alone", and it turns out ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS IS SHOUTO??
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:45</span><br />
um? <br/>
i thought you liked shouto?? like, dont you chat and get along and stuff
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:46</span><br />
YEAH. HE GETS ALONG GREAT WITH <strong><em>SHUTTAI</em></strong>.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:48</span><br />
um okay <br/>
can you maybe spell out exactly what you're upset about, im running on like 2h of sleep
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:51</span><br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH <br/>
Shouto gets along with SHUTTAI not MIDORIYA IZUKU.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:51</span><br />
i still don't know what youre <br/>
oh <br/>
oh NO
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:51</span><br />
OH YES
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:51</span><br />
im so sorry?? i honestly forgot????
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:51</span><br />
you FORGOT I have a <em>secret identity</em>??????
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:52</span><br />
in all fairness i tried having a secret identity and it lasted all of a month, legit everyone knew they just politely pretended not to <br/>
also can you not just tell him? shouto's cool, im sure it'd be fine
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:54</span><br />
it would NOT be fine because i would DIE OF EMBARRASSMENT <br/>
I thought maybe it was a different shouto, it's not like it's THAT rare of a name but KOICHI <br/>
ITS OBVIOUSLY THE SAME SHOUTO <br/>
NO ONE ELSE COULD TALK LIKE SUCH A SUSPICIOUS OLD MAN <br/>
I AM DYING, KOICHI
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:55</span><br />
bro calm down, you could tell him and he'd be chill with it, or not tell him and he'd never notice bc lets be real <br/>
that boys real thick
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:55</span><br />
