-->


<!-- 
  todo: 
  - format the comments section for the blog post? idk what to do for this 
  - fix formatting for shouto discord section  (its not broken, just clunky maybe. ask beta.)
  - which ok does shouto use (i think its Ok (update, its Okay in qab1))
  
  
  done: 
  - + LOL WHERE IS MIDORIYA THIS ENTIRE CHAPTER
  - + kirishima?? in some capacity?? Baku saying "im still working on it" and kirishima saying "idc anymore". alt, kiri saying "what's up w kaminari" *second one *could move this to 34, kiri says it and bakugou immediately acts
  - + hawks himi convo about denki? offers to help her break the law/hpsc
  - //himi twitter; maybe about her relationship problems? but she talks about that a lot
  - todoroki has to have some reaction to the server being gone?? maybe reaches out to a bunch of people who are perpetually offline? shuttai, crawler, engineman, bluenoise, (not rai), maybe touya lol, then finally bloodlove
  - where did that section go, of shouto saying "what happened to the server" and denki saying "literally do not talk to me" //idk i lost it 
  - move those two sections to 12 
  -  mention a crawler update?? just that he's suffering. possibly in communications with la brava, or still just pop 
  //combine these
  - himiko has to find out nighteye is after denki (or has him on camera in some way) 
  //can move to 12?  //moved to 12 
  - new intro section
  - throw in a news section (include cowgirl) 
  - fuyumi - "you are not going back there" //nix? //throw in 12?
  - crawler/bluenoise about himiko? //moved to ch34
  - dabi name 
  - himiko name 
  - reddit likes
  - fix dabi shouto section //could have dabi be a jerk and let on somehow that its about hawks snubbing him //didnt, but still could if i think of anything good
  - twitter likes/retweets
  - + finish news section
  - timestamaps 
  - **kacchan/todo, should say something that tips todo off by ch12 /just gonna do it ch12
    - figure out where the frame leak is (maybe gmail) 
  - **replace gmail with new gmail (see "new 14", copy pasta)
  
today is thursday (10/8)

      I'd be mad but I'm too busy being confused. It reads as a promo piece, but 1) Gentle Criminal has less than 100 subscribers, and 2) have you seen him? He wears a suit in all of the videos I've seen so far, but it's clearly seen better days. If this guy had the funds to pay off Shuttai of all people, why wouldn't he buy himself some better clothes?

 If Shuttai could be paid off, why would he constantly be going for the HPSC's throat? He's never been in it to make friends or censor himself.

  Unless going after the HPSC was paid for by someone else. Like the League of Villains.

  I haven't been following QAB as closely for the last few months but I had to see if other people were as weirded out by that post as I was. Glad to see we're all in this insane boat together.

  I also watched some of the videos. They're not terrible (though a lot of the comedy value is accidental) but I can't find any tie between QAB and Gentle Criminal previous to [yesterday's] post. Shuttai doesn't have a twitter, but Gentle does and he's never once talked about QAB or any politics that might indicate support for QAB. La Brava makes a lot of appearances on both Gentle's videos and his twitter, and I found a few instances of her talking badly about preluders. But honestly, who doesn't hate preluders? So in conclusion, I'm just as lost as you are, OP.

Eraserhead,
 <br/><br/>
I hope this email finds you well. Unfortunately, I am reaching out to inform you that one of your students, Kaminari Denki, was a participant in yesterday's riot at Kasumigaseki. Attached you will find irrefutable video proof.
<br/><br/>
As the individual in question is both a minor and a hero student under your care, I leave the disciplinary actions up to you regarding this behavior. However, should proper measures not be taken, be aware that I will be forced to take legal action.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, please inform Kaminari Denki that in the coming weeks he may be called in for questioning concerning Q.A.B.'s involvement with this incident.
<br/><br/>
Thank you,

<br/><br/>

  You mean you have evidence of my student participating in a legal protest? Don't you have anything better to do than rat out high school students for ditching class?

    You have the gall to say that when Shuttai was directly responsible for Fat Gum's license being revoked? That's what instigated all of this.

    I'm not saying I think he planned this, that would be too much credit. And don't call me bro.
 </span><span class=tw-box-left1>
   People can be dangerous without it being purposeful. The fact of the matter is, QAB is a radical movement and Shuttai is its leader. They listen to him. They attack the HPSC for him. Do I need to give you examples of what more they could do to hurt society?
