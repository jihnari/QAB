  As we suspected, Nighteye had been in the process of investigating us.

  More relevantly, it turns out Nighteye had outside help bringing in Yonamine

<span class="line-box-right1">
  Are you aware of the QAB group? Apparently they've been making quite a name for themselves as an alliance of vigilantes. They're new enough that they could have gotten it in their heads that picking a fight with us was a good idea.
</span><span class="line-time-right">

  Or maybe Nighteye contracts with vigilantes now.

  Those fools on twitter? They're nothing more than the media's latest scapegoat, they don't have the structure or resources to know what Yonamine played.
</span><span class="line-time-left">

  There's another rumor that QAB has ties with the League of Villains.

  Unlikely. If Shigaraki had an ally like that, he wouldn't have folded to us so easily. Keep looking.
