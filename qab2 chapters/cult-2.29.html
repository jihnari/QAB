Wow you QAB folk are real mad about that huh? Tell me why I, a student at UA, would be happy that someone in my industry got fired over a publicity stunt

Just block me if you're gonna be a bitch about it.

  Hi I know this is weird and I know we don't really know each other all that well and I don't want to bother you or anything but I just really wanted to talk to someone who like gets it and I don't want to come off as insane on main but if I'm a bother just let me know and I'll go  <br/>
  But you also have the industry experience to tell me if I'm reading too much into things or if I'm misunderstanding or if I just need to mind my own business instead of, I don't know, writing an entire blog post and getting an innocent person potentially fired 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:22</span><br /> 
  uh hi <br/>
  whats up?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:22</span><br /> 
  It's like, this whole All Might thing. It has my head all messed up <br/>
  I LOVE All Might I am OBSESSED with All Might and I say that and you might think I'm just a regular All Might fan but you'd be wrong I am THE All Might fan and it's to the point where it's not normal but that's just how I live my life, that's how I've always lived my life ever since I was a little kid and I'm just prefacing with all of this because I need you to know that I love and respect All Might when I say this  <br/>
  Is All Might bad for society?
</p>
  
<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:22</span><br /> 
  u might hav 2 clarfy 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:24</span><br /> 
  I don't mean the man himself except I sort of do because how do you separate the man from his decades long career and I know the stats I know he lowered crime in Japan by 3% and I know he's saved countless people. But when did quirk laws get so restrictive? When did heroes become the only people able to legally use what is literally part of their own bodies in public? And what is with everyone's seeming inability to see a world without All Might, or a direct All Might replacement? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:25</span><br /> 
  n thts a bad thing? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:25</span><br /> 
  It's literally setting the entirety of Japan up with a single point of failure 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:25</span><br /> 
  dont trust us othr heros 2 handl it?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:25</span><br /> 
  It's not about if I trust you to handle it or not  <br/>
  It's about if Japan at large trusts you to handle it <br/>
  If Japan at large can see the gaping hole All Might would leave behind and not panic or take advantage of it 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:26</span><br /> 
  i do see what u mean <br/>
  but u might be ovrthnkng it <br/>
  not in tht its not a problm  <br/>
  but other heroes WOULD rise up n try 2 fill tht gap n it might be chaos in th meantme but i trust tht it wud work out 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:26</span><br /> 
  But people would die in that meantime 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:27</span><br /> 
  this is goin 2 sound rly harsh but  <br/>
  ppl die  <br/>
  im not sayng its a good thng  <br/>
  n if we can avoid it we should but we cant endlssly beat ourslvs up ovr smth tht cant be changd 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:27</span><br /> 
  Can't it? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:28</span><br /> 
  idk  <br/>
  mebe it cud <br/>
  what wud u do abt it?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:28</span><br /> 
  I don't know exactly. But I think the first step would be to get people to realize there's a problem 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:28</span><br /> 
  n ud do that via ur blog?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:28</span><br /> 
  Yeah. But. Last time I did something like that, Fat Gum got suspended <br/>
  People read the post, understood that there was a problem, and ran with it. Somewhere along the way it became something else <br/>
  I don't know <br/>
  It's a mess  <br/>
  I don't know what to do 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:29</span><br /> 
  mebe u need 2 give ppl more dirction 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:29</span><br /> 
  What do you mean?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:30</span><br />

  im sure some ppl saw wht u were gettng at but othrs jst saw an adult who should hav done bettr n didnt  <br/>
  if ur mor clear abt the problm n what u thnk ppl should do abt it then it might help 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:34</span><br /> 
  Oh  <br/>
  I see what you mean  <br/>
  It really was my fault 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:34</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:36</span><br /> 
  Crawler is really busy with other stuff, I don't want to bug him  <br/>
  There is one other friend I go to about this stuff but like 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:36</span><br /> 
  but like?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:38</span><br /> 
  It's extremely complicated and very stupid but I made a massive ass of myself in front of him and he doesn't even know it was me but I'm still mortified and I can't even imagine trying to talk to him like normal right now, because how would that even go? I can't just pretend it never happened, I couldn't even sleep last night and I have so many other bigger problems to worry about but this one, with this friend, is the one that's wrecking me and that's just so so stupid because we barely even know each other? We're barely even friends? Except we ARE friends but he doesn't fully know who I am or anything real about me so maybe it should matter less but it doesn't matter less and I hate it and I hate that I'm so paralyzed by this that I can't even do anything because not doing anything just makes everything worse 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:38</span><br /> 
  i feel like ur not breathng so mebe do that  <br/>
  idk wht weird identy gams ur playng but it sounds 2 me liek u should jst talk 2 him?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:39</span><br /> 
  I mean <br/>
  Yeah <br/>
Probably  <br/>
But what if I make it worse
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:39</span><br /> 
  not tryin 2 be sarcastc but <br/>
  can u mak it wors?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:40</span><br /> 
  Well  <br/>
  I mean I guess it is already about as bad as it can get  <br/>
  And I'm probably not doing myself any favors by pretending it didn't happen, because we all know it happened <br/>
  But thinking about talking to him  <br/>
  Ugh  <br/>
  Sorry I really have taken up a lot of your time  <br/>
  But I really appreciate you listening and also your advice 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">hawks_unofficial</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:41</span><br />

  i havent slept much so this might be the energy drink talking but did you take out the yakuza
  </span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  like is that a thing you went out of your way to do and for some reason did it in a way that would never be tracked back to you because. i dont know. i cant figure that part out, because youre a pro hero why would you just do it above board and arrest them yourself, it makes no sense
</span><span class="signal-box-left3">
  i feel like im going insane but it wasn't kazuho and they didn't take THEMSELVES out and the fact that ryukyu has been involved twice when you were the only link

  i dont even know what to think anymore, the resident conspiracy theorist was going off about how overhaul of the hassaikai is secretly prelude the asshole on youtube and twitter and i laughed right along with everyone else but then there was that thing from the police department this morning and they have one of the guys who broke into my place, they have him in custody, but they wont tell me anything about it because of some legal nonsense but i got scared and thought maybe they were trying to spook me so i called in a favor with and ex and i know it was amoral but i really thought they knew some things or maybe you'd told them some things because i knew too much about you and eri and whatever the hell is going on with you and horrifying staples man 
  </span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  but no they won't tell me anything because they arrested the dude during the hassaikai raid 
  </span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  which means he's yakuza

  which means that i wasnt crazy and it really is the yakuza who broke into my apartment while i was gone but why the fuck would they do that 
  </span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  unless it had to do with my beef with prelude

  If I run into Tengai again I'll tell him to expect you, but it sounded like he was going underground. Best to hurry before he tosses his phone.

  It hasn't even been 24 hours <br/>
  There's no way the investigation is a coincidence
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-green">Z-e-D | Sncrime</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  I agree. The timing is too suspicious. Disregarding QAB's tumultuous relationship with the media, the yakuza takedown was handled entirely above board, and by fully licensed heroes. There's nothing suspicious about it... except for the HPSC's reaction
  <br/><span class="dc-emotebox">👆 2</span>
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  not to mention it's ryukyu, a hero with an approval rating almost as high as hawks <br/>
  it absolutely feels like fat gum was them setting a precedence 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-green">Z-e-D | Sncrime</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  I hate that a lot.
</p>

<p class="dc-reply-text2"><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> it'd be a huge overreaction even without that. before this she was only hit with a single warning like 2y ago and it was about propety damage her sidekick had done</p>
<p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | mootmin</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  What's happening with Ryukyu??
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  her office is under investigation and her hero license has been "temporarily suspended"
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:24</span><br />
  Which I for one find EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:25</span><br />
  me for two  <br/>
  the timing is sus af  <br/>
  ryukyu operates above board 110% of the time this is fucking weird is what it is  <br/>
  <span class="dc-link">@Shuttai | mootmin</span> in case you're not up to date ryukyu credited qab for information that lead to the dismantlement of a major crime syndicate just yesterday  <br/>
  that's literally the only out of the ordinary thing she's done probably in her entire life 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:25</span><br />
  What if it's Sir Nighteye? He arrested that member of QAB once just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and then just questioned them for hours about "qab's methods" and "qab's leadership" 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:25</span><br />
  are you talking about yourself in the third person  <br/>
  why are you doing that 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:25</span><br />
  Dude Shuttai is RIGHT there I didn't want to look like a loser!! 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | mootmin</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:26</span><br />
  You got ARRESTED?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:26</span><br />
  he got taken in for questioning, it's not the same thing at all 
</p> 

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:26</span><br />
  There were handcuffs!! I rode in the back of a police vehicle!! 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:27</span><br />
  still not jail  <br/>
  anyway re: ryukyu, the only "weird" thing she did was have an informant who identified as one of us, and publicly thanked them for their service  <br/>
  which is still completely above board  <br/>
  so actually, yeah. sir nighteye. what's up with that guy 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-lblue">bluenoise | snermaid</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:27</span><br />
  he had nothing to do with it 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:27</span><br />
  you don't know that for sure, he could have done something to make the investigation look suspect 
</p> 

<p><span class="dc-name color-lblue">bluenoise | snermaid</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:27</span><br />
  nighteye may have a dislike for qab but he would never do something like that. he's still a good hero  <br/>
  he wouldn't run around getting his colleges suspended 
</p> 

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:27</span><br />
  if not him, then who? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-green">Z-e-D | Sncrime</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:28</span><br />
  Could be the opposite. Maybe the HPSC wasn't setting a precedent they were bullied into admonishing Fat Gum so they're lashing out at anyone related to QAB. 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:28</span><br />
  what, you think a major governmental body has it out for us personally?  <br/>
  you think that's more likely than sir nighteye snapping and taking as many people down with him as he can? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-green">Z-e-D | Sncrime</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:28</span><br />
  Weirder things have happened
</p> 

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:28</span><br />
  As someone who was arrested by that jerk, I still think Sir Nighteye had something to do with it 
</p> 

<p class="dc-reply-text2"><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> As someone who was arrested by that jerk, I still think Sir Nighteye had something to do with it  </p>
<p><span class="dc-name color-lblue">bluenoise | snermaid</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:28</span><br />
  he DIDN'T 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | mootmin</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:29</span><br />
  I cannot believe this <br/>
  It doesn't matter who got Ryukyu in trouble for working with us what matters is that a pro hero got in trouble for WORKING WITH US <br/>
  Not even working! Just accepting an anonymous tip! <br/>
  Are you fucking kidding me 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | rei's face</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:29</span><br />
  there he goes 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-orange">雷人(Rai) | snarchist (snail anarchist)</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:31</span><br />
  Omg he's still typing 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | mootmin</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:32</span><br />
  They can't accept any help now unless it's officially sanctioned? Is that what they're trying to say? Because that's bullshit. That's just gatekeeping PEOPLE'S SAFETY. That's BULLSHIT. How far are people supposed to go to be passive about their own lives? Can't use your quirk in public, can't stop an active crime unless you have the proper license, can't defend yourself unless you want a lawsuit. Now you can't even TELL A HERO about a crime you know is happening? Is that what's going on here? You just have to sit by and let it happen and hope a hero comes by and notices?  <br/>
  And how is barring active heroes from doing their jobs supposed to help anyone, we're just going to sit here as the crime rate increases and more heroes are suspended without due cause and quirk restrictions get tighter until when? Until All Might finally gets forced into retirement or fucking dies pushing himself too hard because there's not enough help to go around and the whole country goes to hell?  <br/>
  Fuck that
