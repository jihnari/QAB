  I haven't uncovered any internal leaks, and Yonamine doesn't seem to have pissed anyone off recently. The prosecution is pushing for the maximum 23 days of holding, and my sources tell me there's a hero agency leaning on the courthouse to make sure it happens. They're likely looking for something to make the charges stick.

</p>


<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:35</span><br />
  LMAO NO<br />
  Like a convention!<br />
  You know, like an event for people with a shared hobby to get together
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:37</span><br />
  Oh<br />
  No, I've never been to one of those<br />
  What kinds of hobbies?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:39</span><br />
  Like, heroes, anime, video games, comic books, or there's even conventions for professionals! Like programming conventions or optometry conventions<br />
  I even saw an event for knitting once, which seems wild to me! But ig there's a lot of people really into knitting and there was some rule about "no crochetters allowed" which I thought was weird because why wouldn't you allowe crochetters? You both make things out of yarn? But apparently the two communities hate each other and there's an entirely separate crochet convention where <em>knitters</em> aren't allowed, and<br />
  Oh whoops I'm rambling, sorry<br />
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:40</span><br />
  Don't apologize, it's really interesting<br />
  I never would have known about the knit versus crochet war otherwise
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:41</span><br />
  Shouto, why are you so nice,,
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:41</span><br />
  ? <br />
  I'm just telling the truth?<br />
  Have <em>you</em> ever been to a convention?
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:43</span><br />
  A few! I've been to herocon twice and I'd like to go again this year but my school schedule has been really busy. It's always a little weird to go by myself but the merch is worth it<br />
  I'm thinking about going to a new convention soon, and I even found someone to go with! But I've never met them before and I'm kind of nervous about it<br />
  But they said there was no pressure if I wanted to cancel, they're cool either going or not going, which is really nice of them! But I don't want to be so wishywashy about it because it's really inconvenient for everyone else involved
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:43</span><br />
  Is there something about the new convention that makes you nervous?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:44</span><br />
  Well I've only ever been to herocon, for one! So it's a totally new type of con and that's a bit intimidating. And it's not the kind of con to have merch, so I'm not really sure what I would even do exactly? Attend panels probably, and hopefully talk to some people but I don't know if people would even want to talk to me, or if it's even the kind of con where people talk to each other... I don't know. There are a lot of unknowns
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:44</span><br />
  If you don't go you might regret it. You can always leave if you don't like it, especially if the person you're going with doesn't care that much in the first place.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 21:46</span><br />
  Hmmmm<br />
  Yeah I guess you're right! No sense in sticking around if I'm uncomfortable, I just forget not everything's like school where you're not allowed to leave if you don't want to be there<br />
  Thanks so much for listening!! It means a lot to me, Shouto-kun 😊
