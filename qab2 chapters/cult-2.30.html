<p class="blog-header">The Future of Heroics</p>
<p class="blog-date"> by Shuttai on October 5, 20X4  -  3 Comments </p>
<p>

A lot of you are probably expecting me to talk about certain heroes who are receiving serious public and legal backlash right now, and I'll get to that. 
<br/><br/>
First, I want to talk about the Provisional Hero License Exam that happened last month. 
<br/><br/>
A total of 1,540 hero students took the exam. In any given year, about 750 of those students would have passed. That is to say, 50%. 
<br/><br/>
This may seem harsh, but keep in mind that first year students take this exam and aren't expected to pass on their first try. The exam is offered twice a year, so after their first failure they'll have five more chances. With a few exceptions, the majority of students passing this exam are third years and skilled second years. 
<br/><br/>
Guess how many passed this year? 
<br/><br/>
151. 
<br/><br/>
Let me say that again: out of 1540 examinees, 151 passed. That's a success rate of 10%, down 40% from every other Provisional Hero License Exam in recent history. 
<br/><br/>
This means students in hero programs went from having a near guarantee of passing the exam by the time they're third years, to looking at a very real failure rate. By the time a first year taking the exam for the first time this year is ready to graduate, they're looking at an average of a 60% pass rate. What about third years, who only have one more shot at passing before they graduate? What's going to be their success rate?
<br/><br/>
This all sounds insane. So is there anything the HPSC is doing to help soften this blow? Sure there is! They're offering make-up classes to some students who failed the exam, as an alternate way to obtain a hero license. 
<br/><br/>
Then hey, why am I upset, right? Why are we talking about this? Sure they made the exam harder, sure they significantly lowered the passing rates, but they're also offering additional help and training to struggling students. 
<br/><br/>
Guess how many students were offered remedial classes after failing the exam?
<br/><br/>
Four. 
<br/><br/>
Four out of 1353 students were offered remedial classes. Are you feeling angry yet? 
<br/><br/>
There was no announcement about raising the difficulty of the exam, nor was there a statement from the HPSC following the exam results. There was also no media coverage concerning the drastic alteration to the exam and the massive decrease in provisional hero licenses issued. 
<br/><br/>
Let's put that aside for a moment and discuss what you probably expected me to talk about, given the recent events. 
<br/><br/>
So: Let's talk about Fat Gum. What is there to say? People were upset about Fat Gum, so upset that the HPSC suspended his hero license. Call and response. The people spoke, and the government listened. Problem solved. 
<br/><br/>
Except the problem wasn't Fat Gum. 
<br/><br/>
Hundreds of heroes take on first year hero students as interns, and nearly all of them accept first year students on the backing school's recommendation. Fat Gum isn't a teacher, he's a professional hero. His job is to prioritize the safety of the citizens in his area, and secondarily he has a responsibility to the interns and side-kicks under his supervision. Given the situation, I don't think he should have been penalized for a lapse of judgment; especially seeing as that lapse of judgment was entirely in line with HPSC internship guidelines. Any student with a provisional license is allowed to engage villains under a trained hero's supervision. Fat Gum was supervising properly, up until he couldn't anymore, and then he made a judgment call that in his mind likely prioritized the safety of the public. My disagreement with that judgment call has no real-world bearing. I wasn't there, and I'm not a pro hero. 
<br/><br/>
The real problem is that when the public brought the issues of these guidelines to the attention of the HPSC, the HPSC offered up Fat Gum as a scapegoat. There's been no discussion of changing the age requirements for interns, or increasing safety measures for minors going into heroics. There's been no acknowledgement of the failing of the rules that got us here in the first place. There's only been the suspension of Fat Gum's hero license. 
<br/><br/>
Let's talk about another hero for a moment: Dragoon Hero, Ryukyu. 
<br/><br/>
Late yesterday afternoon, it was announced that Ryukyu's hero license was being suspended. The reason the HPSC gave at their very short press conference this morning, was that Ryukyu was suspected of working with a criminal organization. Even if this were true, (which is difficult to believe considering this "criminal organization" appears by all rights to be <em>QAB</em>,) the "working with" is a stretch. All official sources indicate Ryukyu accepted a tip about a crime happening, and then followed up on that tip and arrested some criminals. It's possible the tip came from a criminal. So what? Since when has it been illegal to take tips? If a member of a yakuza organization got a hold of a hero to give away information about the group they were a part of, no one would bat an eye. The very reason tip lines are anonymous is because it lets people who know about illegal activities tell someone without consequence. Not accepting tips from "criminals" would mean no more tips. 
<br/><br/>
But the HPSC took some sort of issue with it and, without any legal standing to do so, suspended Ryukyu's hero license. 
<br/><br/>
As we're all learning, the HPSC won't hesitate to suspend good heroes, whether or not they have the right to do so. This will only serve to cultivate an environment of fear, where all ranked heroes second guess their every move to make sure they don't put a toe over the invisible line in the sand. Much like the provisional Hero license exam, the risk of failure has increased drastically overnight, without warning or explanation. In order to stay ahead of it, heroes, both upcoming and experienced, will have to be at the very top, striving for constant improvement and praying they don't trip. 
<br/><br/>
Pushing heroes to compete with each other to a higher degree than ever before, raising the stakes for failure, and all this during an exponential increase in mass speculation over All Might's inevitable retirement. It seemed like awful timing. 
<br/><br/>
Until I realized the timing was the point. The HPSC is just as scared as we are over losing the number one hero and having no one suitable to take his place. That's <em>why</em> they're doing all of this. 
<br/><br/>
They're trying to create another All Might. 
<br/><br/>
By only allowing the top candidates to remain in heroics and artificially increasing the danger and pressure, they're hoping to produce another pillar for society. And yeah, at the time when All Might came to prominence, people needed a single shining beacon of hope. Something grand and unshakable, to show everyone that even in these times of record high crime rates, everything was going to be okay; because All Might was here. 
<br/><br/>
But All Might won't always be here, as we're all starting to realize, and the HPSC is rushing to find a way to restore the system to its former glory. Hero students from Hero Academies like UA and Shiketsu are amazing and competent and they're going to make great heroes. But you can't expect any of them to be able to measure up to someone like All Might, when even full-grown adult heroes with years of field experience can't. Maybe the HPSC's process really can pressure-cook an entire generation of children until one of them rises above the rest and can take the place All Might will leave behind, but how long is that going to take? How many years, or even decades, will the public have to wait? How many villains will run rampant in that time? 
<br/><br/>
How about all of the lives that will be lost during however long it takes for another All Might to appear? 
<br/><br/>
All Might has done so much good, and he's saved countless lives. But relying solely on All Might has made us complacent. All Might is here, so why should we worry? All Might is here, and he can handle it. We've never had to consider what life would be like without him. 
<br/><br/>
Over the last 50 years, restrictions for public quirk usage has only gotten tighter, and the punishments more severe. You can get a license only if your profession requires it and your workplace sponsors you. In an emergency, civilians have been conditioned to not try and save anyone, because they might get in the way of trained professionals. Many people won't even try to save themselves, because that's what heroes are for. Sometimes standing by is the right choice, but what if there aren't any heroes in the area? How long will we sit and wait for someone else to save us? 
<br/><br/>
Being generous and assuming the HPSC's plan even works, what then? We have another All Might, another pillar of society, another singular symbol of peace. 
<br/><br/>
Another single point of failure. 
<br/><br/>
All Might gave us hope, security, and the ability to look towards the future and see it as brighter. But whether we're ready or not, we need to figure out long-term, widespread measures for keeping the people of Japan, the people of the world, safe. 
<br/><br/>
There will always be people who will abuse their power—whether that be their quirk or their position or their wealth. Equally, there will also always be people who use their power for good, people who want to help, if only given the chance. We need to give them that chance. 
<br/><br/>
The Hero Public Safety Commission wants you to look towards the past, to see the way that things have been, and if they have their way, will always be. They don't want anything to change, and who can blame them? Change is new. Change is hard. Change is a lot of fucking work. But as soon as we stop trying to improve ourselves, as soon as we stop fighting for our future, we've lost. 
<br/><br/>
All Might is not responsible for our futures. Even if the rumors of an All Might successor are true, that successor won't be responsible for our futures either. 
<br/><br/>
WE are responsible for our futures. 
<br/><br/>
And we should start acting like it.

  damn, man -- the chilling effect that ryukyu's suspension is going to have on actual hero work is going to be significant. If heroes feel they can't accept anonymous tips for fear of governmental reprisal, we're about to see crime rates skyrocket. Especially with fewer graduating heroes on the streets if shuttai's numbers on the exam play out. Time to go take that firearm class I've been putting off...

  You're completely right about that waiting for rescue thing. I've never really had the drive to pursue hero work even before the changes, but to be honest, my quirk is pretty strong. And I have never attempted to use it in an emergency situation, not even when my life was in immediate danger. Maybe I should do some soul-searching on that.

  Really interesting post, you've given me a lot to think about. The timing of Ryukyu's suspension seemed stranged but when combined with everything else that's happening you're completely right, it's very suspicious- and scary. 
  <br/><br/>
  Interested to hear how you even thought to look at the success rates for the provisional license exam. Anyway, great job.

  <p class="rd-header">The difficulty increase in the hero license exam is warranted </p>
    <p>
      I don't see a problem with making the exam harder. The point of heroes is that they're the experts and have expert level control over their quirks, otherwise they'd be cops. If the hero public safety commission raised the difficulty level of the exam, then it needed to be raised.

  OP is completely right about heroes vs police. It's about time this country got serious about the difference between the two.

  Not to be THAT person, but maybe Prelude was onto something. No quirks, smaller scale crimes. There'd be no need for heroes and we could just have police officers. Problem solved.

  Is this even an unpopular opinion? 
  <br/><br/>
  Also, why is Shuttai so obsessed with hero stats? Is he even a hero student? Does he have family in the industry? If not, it's none of his business.

  People complain about how the government is slow and never makes any changes, and then when they actually make a change everyone's mad about it.

  No one would have thought anything about the hero exam except that QAB made a big stink about it so now it's all anyone can talk about.

glad ppl are FINALLY taking things like this seriously. do i think fatgum is a good hero? YES. do i think he needs to reconsider how he treats his (underage!!) interns and what responsibilities they (literal children!!!) should face? YES. should totally lose his job? NO. but i DO think he needs to use this time to reflect on what went wrong and how he can do better in the future. hopefully other heroes will take this as a sign/warning and ACTUALLY change how things are done before they get suspended too

Let's talk about QAB. 
<br/><br/>
I'm sure we've all heard about QAB by this point (unless you've been living under a societal rock). Written under the moniker Shuttai, it started pretty simple: a Quirk Analysis Blog. Shuttai ran this blog for years with minimal engagement, until earlier this year when it was promoted by some big twitter accounts.
<br/><br/>
Shuttai is very prolific, posting at minimum one blog post a week, so while I do recommend reading the blog posts yourself I can understand why this might not be feasible for everyone. <span class="tblr-link">Here</span> is an earlier post I made with a list of the blog posts I consider most important, especially concerning the discussion we're about to have. Most important by far is <span class="tblr-link">the blog Shuttai posted last night</span>. If you read nothing else, please at least read that. 
<br/><br/>
Ready? Okay.

    1000% agreed. Anyone saying "Shuttai wasn't always anti-HPSC" has simply not been paying attention.

  The point is that these are CHILDREN they're sending into high risk situations and ordering to engage with combatants. Society is basically raising child soldiers.

    "high risk situations", "engaging with combatants". You couldn't possibly mean......... their <em>job</em>? This is literally the worst take I've ever seen. Why are you treating this like we're at war??
    <br/><br/>
    What are interns supposed to do, not learn anything? What do you expect to happen to heroics at that point, just cease to exist? Sounds like a great plan. Totally reasonable to remove a highly paid and highly respected job from the market entirely just because you don't like the idea of on-the-job learning or something, I don't even know what your problem is. Japan has been doing this for literal years, and the education system surrounding the whole process has only gotten better and more stringent.

  Yeah we've been doing this for years, you know what else we've been doing for years? Using fossil fuels. You really want to defend something based on how long we've been doing it?

  The heroics industry has a lot of problems, and we need to address them. Fat Gum's suspension is a good start.

  So it's your first rally prep list: <br/>
  -Bring and wear lots of sunscreen (spray versions are the best options for on the go) <br/>
  -Bring water and high-energy snacks! (peanut butter, biscuits) <br/>

  -Mini first aid kits - plasters, antiseptic, gauze, safety pins, sterile water<br/>
-Cannot stress this enough – wear comfortable shoes to walk in<br/>
-Make or bring placards or signs to hold that expresses your take on the situation – it helps to bring attention to the cause<br/>
-If, at any point, you’re not comfortable, remove yourself from the rally – maybe you’re feeling light-headed, there are talks of violence you’re not okay with, walk away until you are okay to join again<br/>
