<!-- +interview:stain:8/22 (was 26) -->
[Excerpt from the transcription of an interview performed by Indie-Pendants on August 22, 20X4]
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>
"H-hello, excuse me! Mister, uh, Stain? It is you, isn't it? You are the vigilante known as 'Stain', aren't you?"

"Who's asking?"

"Oh, I'm, we're an independent media outlet, and um, we wanted to, uh, maybe ask? You, that is—"

"Get to the point."

"Well, we were wondering if you had any opinions on Q. A. B?"

"Q. A. B.? You mean those feisty vigilante kids? They should keep it up, they're doing All Might's work."

</em>[loud whisper, close to the microphone]<em> "Is that like 'God's work' but with All Might?"

</em>[quieter whisper, further from the microphone]<em> "Shut up, Gary!"

"Um, one more question, Mr. Stain, if you don't mind?"

"Make it quick."

"How about Prelude? Many consider him to be radical, but others are calling him 'the next Darwin'. Do you have a stance?"

"Who?"

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:12</span><br />
Hello.<br/>
How was coffee with your new friend?
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:12</span><br />
HHNNNN
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:12</span><br />
?
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:15</span><br />
IT WAS <br/>
GOOD<br/>
Okay so it was actually amazing he was so nice I can't believe it I was so sure his public persona was just that, a persona for the media, but it's NOT he's so NICE and he just let me rant at him about quirk science for an hour and then he let me watch him use his quirk up close and this was probably the best day I've ever had and I could die happy??
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:16</span><br />
Cool <br/>
What do you mean "public" is he famous?
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:16</span><br />
OH <br/>
UH <br/>
PRETEND I DIDNT SAY THAT PLEASE
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:16</span><br />
🤷 ok <br/>
Glad you had a good time. <br/>
:)

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 14:18</span><br />
Thanks!! Me too!!! 😊
