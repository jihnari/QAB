    Celebrities and heroes are no strangers to unrelated third-parties profiting off of their brands; we've all seen the monstrosity that is Garfield Might. But this latest scam targeting the perfume market may be the first of its kind. The extremely popular <em>Sweet Dreams</em> by Midnight has sold over 200k units. Pro Hero Midnight says she had no knowledge of the perfume until this week: "I never launched any perfume lines. You guys do know I'm a high school teacher, right? When would I have time for that?"

    What would have been a smooth rescue operation only a few years ago turned into three minor injuries for civilians on Monday afternoon. After a bank heist attempt on Shinsei Bank in Ginza had been taken care of, Rock Lock said the senior hero seemed "like he was slipping" and "became tired quickly". Though All Might had come directly from another save, this is certainly cause for alarm seeing as this is hardly his first fumble.

  The torrid romance between rancher Nousore Jo and his bovine trespasser, Kawai Touru, has been the talk of Tokyo for months, but is the honeymoon phase over before it's even begun? An email from would-be-bride's family to Nousore revealed a shocking truth: Kawai's quirk isn't a cow mutation at all. "I don't know what to think," said Nousore, looking shaken even days after the discovery. "Her quirk doesn't matter to me. But the lying does."

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Hello Ryukyu-san, this is Bubblegirl from Sir Nighteye's agency. I got your number from Centipeder, who got it from Gang Orca. I apologize if this is untoward.  
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  I have some information pertinent to the current Hassaikai investigation that I need to share. 
</span>


<span class="sms-box-left">
  Yes, I remember you. Bubble quirk, right? 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Why come to me? Sir Night Eye is the lead agency on this investigation 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Is he alright? 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  no no he's fine
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  I obtained the information via means that Sir Night Eye wouldn't approve of 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Just tell him. He'll find out sooner or later
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I can't do that. He'd KILL ME.  
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  ??? Do we need to get the police involved
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I can help you file a restraining order 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Sorry, that was unprofessional, I'm a little stressed out. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  I'm sure he wouldn't actually kill me, but he would likely fire me. And probably make sure I never work in the hero industry ever again. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Are you aware of his zero tolerance QAB policy? 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  What
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I quite literally only found out about QAB last week
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  What does a zero tolerance policy even mean 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  It's very complicated. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  And maybe not best done over insecure means. Would you have time to meet in person? 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I can get a break in two hours, come to Shinjuku

  The real criminals are the HPSC for ignoring the cries of the people to remove Fat Gum from his position. Over 100 thousand signatures and nothing but silence. Shameful.

  The Yakuza group?

  Yes. Chisaki Kai will likely be present and your quirk is our best chance for dealing with him with minimal risk to everyone involved

  Isn't that Sir Nighteye's case?

  That is correct. However, I have an informant who is only willing to work with us if we keep Sir Nighteye uninvolved

  What kind of informant is it that you're willing to work with them anyway?
