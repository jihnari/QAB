I'm unfollowing everyone who retweets anything related to QAB. I just can't believe we're still talking about this and DEFENDING this kind of behavior.

there's a line and qab crossed it big time

insane that people are only waking up to this now, qab has ALWAYS been like this

***want to keep this somewhere, hawks feels bad and is running interference. but it doesnt really work if the backlash is weird 
//cut this? hmmm //could also open with this but ehhhhh
//alt, hawks posts this, people respond below "ok but what was up with the latest post tho" 
11__10/8 //causes people to cancel hawks?  //could cut entirely
//alt, smth about how shuttai isnt the cause of the riot, he told people to take a stand and they did. he never told anyone to get violent about it.

i wish y'all would stop and think for a sec about how you're condemning a guy who runs a blog about quirks. 
shuttai isn't his fanbase.

Has Denki been talking to you at all?

no :(( 
you? 

Sort of 
I tried to talk to him about something <earlier/yesterday> and he was kind of rude about it I think 

rude?? denki??? 
i mean he gets kind of over enthusiastic sometimes and that can annoy people but rude??

Yes I thought it was strange 

//talk about the server nuke, himiko knows about it, tells him, asks if she can add todo to the gc

deku crisis 
+12__10/7ish //late late
//i think this would be best done in two parts, one early to show that its still bothering deku and one late after crawler has had a think, maybe talked to some people (hawks?)
izuku crawler,
> yeah i was initially leaning towards friend Z telling Y "you're different from X, it's not the same at all" but i don't believe that. and then, "but the intent was different, and you'll change, but X won't (so it's different)" but i don't believe that either. so i think ultimately i need to absolve both of them lol, it's the public's fault üòå

    intentions do matter, to a degree

but what matters more is the individual. they all made a choice, even if that choice was informed by something you said.
//can i say "and thats a beautiful/very human thing to do, whether its you or prelude"?

//crawler has been thinking about this for the last few days and he has smth to say about it and the nature of responsibility /culpability

if he did go to court over this it wouldn't go well for him
but he didn't mean to do it 
and he's like 15 
not that the court system would care 
i just don't see the point in him "facing justice" because of shit that he didn't do 

It's the internet 
Whatever those losers do is their own fault 

legally that's debatable 
also you literally have the most twitter followers of anyone i know 
well second most 
but i have a FRACTION of your followers and after i broke 1k there was a serious pressure to watch what i said 

Who the hell is the first 
And I'm not saying you don't watch what you say but that's for your own sanity that's not for anyone else's sake 
You don't owe your followers anything 

you're literally self sustaining because of your fans 

How they choose to spend their money is none of my business. Their personal lives are also none of my business 
I love each and every one of my fans and im grateful they choose to love and follow me but if they're a dipshit who does something illegal how is that my fault? 
It isn't. I don't even know them. 
Stop typing I'm not done. 
I get the urge to feel responsible for people who's lives you've touched in some way. You probably don't remember but a few years back this guy named [x] went crazy and stabbed a bunch of people on the train. One girl died. They didn't know much about him, a neet who'd dropped out of high school and lived with his mom, but he had a picture of me as his phone background and even though he didn't mention me in any of the news broadcasts I was getting a ton of DMs about it and people kept [atting me] publicly and demanding answers I didn't have. 

holy shit
why didn't i know about this?
why didn't you tell me? 

I didn't tell anyone. 
I was really embarassed and for a while I did feel sort of responsible. I kept coming up with these insane scenarios where I could have stopped it somehow. Or worse, I couldn't stop it because that's the sort of freak I attract as an idol, and maybe all of my fans were like that.
But fuck that. 
They aren't all like that and I'm done feeling guilty for something I didn't do. 
Anyway, tell Shuttai to stop worring so much. No one died and even if they did he's not responsible for the actions of other people. 

we're talking about this later 
you shouldn't have had to deal with this by yourself 

Sure 
Later as in over dinner? 

ok. yeah. maybe. 
ive gotta talk to shuttai first

//cut from 34, but good notes? 
some indication of the future, mention the meta liberation front, smth about announcing their support for the radical group known as QAB 
The Meta Liberation Army, known more commonly as the MLA, has announced their public support for the radical group known as QAB. According to their spokesperson 
ok no theyre pretty underground, its just destro's book 
Meta Liberation War, by Chikara Yotsubashi
https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Meta_Liberation_War

so rather, a group known for their belief/central whatever in their central text, the one above 

better, 
experts warn that this isnt the end of qab?
though the damage for now has been contained 
the radical terrorist group known as MLA has recently seen a resurgence in popularity
if mla and qab merge it could sign trouble for the peaceful days of japan, blah blah
