<p> Sorry there's only one this week, but let's get right down to it! "Fear Mongering" is a quirk that activates when the user talks to the target, and appears to work by stimulating the fear center of amygdala. This is a fascinating concept, because what if the other functions of the amygdala can be triggered as well? If the [...]  </p>

<p> U.A. is notorious for allowing the expulsion of an entire class of hero students, operating on a principle of "the teachers know best." What did those students do post-expulsion? In Japan's federal prison, 82% of all incarcerated individuals did not finish high school, and a study from 20X1 shows high schools are more likely to deny gap year students [...]</p>

Yes, I agree. It's foolish of Shuttai to keep denying Stain when they share many of the same beliefs. The joining of their two groups would be a force to be reckoned with.

<p class="art-title1">First Ever "Quirkless" Convention </p>
<p class="shift-up art-author">BY TSUDA CHINATSU<br/>Updated: Aug. 23, 20X4 at 7:28 PM </p>
<hr class=art-line>
<p class=art-content><br/>
The name of this convention alone is enough to raise eyebrows. "Quirkless" Con (or "QCon", as it's being marketed) is the first ever of its kind: A convention for quirkless, by quirkless. According to Otoba Yukie, co-organizer of QCon, interest for such a convention has spiked considerably as the popular internet blog "Q. A. B." continues to bring up culturally sensitive matters like job placement disparity and the comparatively high suicide rates in individuals diagnossed as "quirkless".
<br/><br/>
"We want to make this clear," said Otoba in a recent interview, "this is not an offline meeting for Q. A. B. While it is true that Q. A. B. helped inspire the creation of this convention, and many of the founders are fans, we don't want to make this about Q. A. B. We want to use this convention to raise awareness to the issues quirkless people face in their day to day lives."
<br/><br/>
When asked about the legality of disallowing quirked individuals into a publicly funded event, Otoba had this to say: "We're not keeping quirked people out, we're just asking that quirks not be the focus of discussion. We want to focus on the strengths and uniqueness in individuals outside of their quirks. We are accepting of all who wish to attend, but our hope is to create a comfortable space of growth and comradery for those who feel weighed down by the abundance of quirks both in their lives and in media. That's what QCon is all about."
<br/><br/>
The convention is set for November 26, and will include resume building workshops, quickless activism discussions, mental health awareness panels.
<br/><br/>
More information can be found at QCon's official website, <a>www.qcon20X4.jp</a>.
