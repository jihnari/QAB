cow rancher > fix //what was i fixing //timing maybe? 
eri mention? (mebe move to extra)

which ok does koichi and shuttai use
shouto dabi section? could be funny /maybe nix
fix kiri text pattern? i think he caps I (double check) (he does)
crawler/pop/iida section?? maybe unsure about how to handle shuttai


done: 
+ some hawks dabi section
+ sends message to dabi saying if he's murdered Himiko did it 
//- 11?,hawks hits up crawler says he pissed some major people off and if he dies crawler should break into his apartment and get eri  (and burn his porn?) then 12, gets back in with himi and says "false alarm maybe" ""maybe"?? " //could still do this, put near the end? or could ditch, too exciting for a thread we'll never tie. 
+ could bring back tumblr (maybe save it for 34, people going wild out of order, new ships 
//himi denki reconciliation? skip this and imply it for the future? 
+ mei released?
+ some section with bakugou??
+ denki apologizes to shouto (so shouto can deliver his joke)
+ mla support qab future plot
+ allmight reconciliation 
+ mei released after effects? 
+ smth that finally tips todoroki off that deku is shuttai

+ (hawks/deku, deku/gentle), new hot takes on all sides, etc)
+ some resolution(?) with ryukyu and fatgum //added mei section, could add another news section (this is kind of resolved w mei's ending)
+ gmail w nedzu telling people to ignore nighteye but that ua will be cooperating w the local police

+ nighteye /yagi 
+ mei 
+ deku 
//aizawa 
+ cowlady 


threads to tie up: 
- +himiko and hawks, 🤝
- +denki being a jerk /intervention/reconciliation 
- anything with eri? //maybe hawks is at the office and she makes him dino nuggets so he'll come home and he says well can't argue with that 
- something with dabi/hawks, could be a himi dabi interaction saying chill ur tits. could say "my boyfriend now 🥰" "wft ur like 12" "excuse you im 17. and im going to take waayyyy better care of hawks than you ever did so suck on that" //later, himi, hawks "heads up dabi thinks we're dating maybe" "???? why???" "i was pissed off dont worry about it, just wanted to give you a heads up" 
- bakugou almost convinces deku he's not a bad person? 
- crawler fully convinces deku he's not a bad person (mostly) ("you're not a monster/like prelude")
- mei gets out of jail 
- nighteye find out about deletion hack and moves to the next stage 
- all might reconnects with nighteye 
- +mirio gets afo (future)
- +qcon gets renewed
- +qab gets deleted ? 
- SOMETHING with aizawa/teachers chat 
- crawler should talk to bluenoise about something tie-y-up-y

  As I'm sure you're all aware, certain Pro Hero Agencies have been contacting individual UA staff directly for questions reguarding the recent protest at HPSC headquarters. While we understand their reasoning, the volume of these requests has become burdensome to our ability to preform our roles as educators. All further queries from these outside sources will be handled by my office. 
  <br/><br/>
  UA's official statement on the matter is that we are cooperating with the Toyko Metropolitan Police Department in order to settle any concerns they may have, but not at the cost of our students' educations. 
  <br/><br/>
   Notification about UA's change as per handling these communications has gone out to the relevant Agencies, as well as the Toyko Metropolitan Police Department.  Do not feel the need to respond to further contact from these parties. If they persist, please direct them to this email, or my UA phone number. I will happily field any questions they might retain, assuming these questions occur during business hours. 
  <br/><br/>
  Please note that a mandatory meeting has been added to your calendars for tomorrow morning. As tomorrow is a Saturday, virtual attendence will be permitted but not encouraged. Please prepare any questions you may have ahead of time and email them to Inui-sensei. 
  <br/>
  Thank you,

    Businesses affected by the destruction on Tuesday are working hard to rebuild and reopen—but workers say they still deserve to be paid, despite the time off. "My manager told me to wait it out and they'll tell me when I'm back on the schedule," says Kazumi Yui, a clerk at a local 7-Eleven caught up in the violence. "They don't even give me benefits, and now they want me to wait around and not get paid?" Kazumi says she'll likely be forced to quit, even though doing so will mean forfeiting the possibility of any hazard pay or back pay.

    Ryukyu Agency, Mt. Agency, and several others have announced they intend to take the Hero Public Safety Commission - the Cabinet Office in charge of the distribution of Pro Hero licenses and handling of Pro Hero affairs - to court, regarding the perceived overstep in authority. In an interview with Japan Today, Pro Hero Ryukyu had this to say: "We ask for your support and understanding. Restrictions on public quirk usage has reached a point where this isn't just about heroes being able to do their jobs anymore. It's about people being able to live their lives."

While many corporations continue to distance themselves from QAB and enacting policies to prevent employees from participating in future protests, the Detnerat Company has announced their full support of the anti-HPSC movement on their official Twitter. "The call to action is clear and the corruption obvious. Anyone against the brave future leaders of our society is welcome to apply elsewhere," the post says. Many replies are rebuking the Detnerat Company for siding with what the local authorities are calling terrorists. Others are rallying with Detnerat, including Suiran, the

  I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself. You seem like a reasonable, if reactionary, person. After what happened on Tuesday, it's only a matter of time before QAB gets dismantled. 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  A lot of people are going to go to jail for this, and if you don't want to be one of them I suggest you come forward with what you know.

    uh yeah?? <br/>

    your name is literally... your name   <br/>
    and your family is high profile  <br/>
    and you were on TV for the UA sports fest  <br/>

    well anyway back to rai  <br/>
    idk if im outing him or whatever but you know he went to the protest a few days ago?

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:54</span><br /> 
      Yes I know. I'm just surprised, given that Sir Nighteye is the same pro hero to detain Kaminari for several hours <during that one event months ago>

      has he been holding a grudge this entire time?? dude

  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 11:01</span><br /> 
    yeah same  <br/>
    idk what evidence or whatever nighteye has but it cant be too damning or kaminari would be in jail already  <br/>
    unless they're waiting to serve all the arrest warrants at the same time shit guess i gotta read more up on law again  <br/>
    nighteye really really wants to arrest some people <br/>
    the hpsc also haha we are so fucking screwed  <br/>
    sorry forget i said that i am thinking positive i am breathing deeply i am googling my rights  <br/>
    anyway wanted to give him a heads up and couldn't get a hold of him <br/> 
    could you forward along the message 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 11:04</span><br />

    um  <br/>
    why? 
  </p>

      Himiko says he doesn't handle emotional stress very well and that he's already "in a bad way". He's been attempting to keep a low profile following the protest. Telling him this would only cause more stress he couldn't do anything about  <br/>
      But if it becomes relevant I'll let him know  <br/>
      Or do you think I should let him know regardless?
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 11:08</span><br /> 
    idk man  <br/>
    he's your friend you probably know him better than i do but you're right that he cant really do anything more than stay out of trouble  <br/>
    ill let you know if i find out anything else 
  </p>

  I said I'd provide you with updates about Kaminari <br/>
  A pro hero has evidence against him  <br/>
  As well as a grudge  <br/>
  I've decided not to tell Kaminari about it for now, but tell me if you believe this decision to be in error

We apologize to inform you that we were unable to process your request for server data regarding server with the ID 787522828005408788. An isolated power outage caused some server storage data to be lost. We do not expect to be able to recover this data.

  Why did Kirishima tell you to check up on me?

  Like I fucking know

  I have more than one friend.

  The fucking nerd? That has nothing to do with you

  I think it's a bit inappropriate to call his legal trouble "dumb"

  He told you about that??

<span class="sms-box-right">
  What a fucking loser 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  There is no legal trouble it's just the nerd blowing things out of proportion 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  If he brings it up again tell him posting shit online isn't illegal, that's what fucking free speech is for

<span class="sms-box-left">

    I think a lot of people legitimately didn't know. QAB broke containment in the best and worst ways. Sure, the blog itself is popular in its own right but it's not the same level of say, the mainstream news. 
    <br/><br/>
    When the news anchor on NHK says things like "QAB is suspected of murder" or "QAB is assumed to be responsible for the riot" or "A piece of artwork stolen 70 years ago was donated to the smithsonian by QAB", no one thinks of that behavior being linked to a blog site. And the word "blog" never really comes up, given all the other shit going on. 
    <br/><br/>
    Actually, it's entirely possible the NHK lady also does not know it stands for blog.

Hey sorry I just saw this <br/>
Things have been a little insane, I'm sure you've seen the news
I don't want to say too much since I've recently learned like
Some things about internet safety <br/>
But I did want to tell you what was going on because none of this is fair to you <br/>
Crawler and I talked about it and we decided to delete the discord server because it seemed irresponsible and possibly illegal to leave it up. And in hindsight maybe we should have made an announcement about it or given people more time but with everything going on we didn't want to risk it. <br/>
I really hope for the best for everyone who was there, and I had a lot of good times in the server, but I wasn't close to anyone there like I am with you. So I wanted to tell you this all personally but also I wanted to let you know that after everything that's happened, I think it's probably best if I delete my account. <br/>
I can't tell you everything, I can't even tell you most of it, and I'm really sorry about that. You deserve a better explanation but I'm not in a position to provide it. But I wanted to say that you were a really good friend to me and I really appreciated it. <br/>
And I know all of this sounds really final but you never know! We could run into each other in real life and not even know it. So maybe this isn't the end but for now, good bye, Shouto. <br/>
I'll miss you. 
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20</span><br /> 
  Who is this? <br/>
  Shuttai? <br/>
  Oh 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:44</span><br /> 
  I did some research online and it looks like it's possible to restore a deleted account within a certain time frame so in the case that you decide to do that I wanted to say that I enjoyed talking with you and being your friend. <br/>
  I understand and respect your decision. And if you decide it's safe to come back, I'll be here. <br/>
  And I hope you're right <br/>
  I hope this isn't the end

I mean, who's the next target? Do we keep going after the HPSC? Do we send rallying forces for Ryukyu? Are we going after the TMPD next? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:16</span><br /> 
uh <br/>
we dont really have targets <br/>
we mostly just chill unless someones like getting mugged and then we jump in <br/>
and then go back to chilling

You have an entire army of people angry and hungry for change, and you're going to let that fizzle out? You could do anything. 
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:16</span><br /> 
yeah but the people who would do that sort of thing have all gone underground 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shurui</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:16</span><br /> 
or gotten arrested  
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:16</span><br /> 
or that <br/>
i think maybe they have the right idea 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Mei</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br /> 
You think it's the right idea to keep letting the HPSC abuse their power and gaslight people? <br/>
You think it's right to let Ryukyu stay suspended? <br/>
You think it's right to let the news keep running their smear campaign and keep calling QAB violent terrorists? 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br /> 
im not saying those are good things but im not confident we can actually change anything 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Mei</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br /> 
I am <br/>
I'm confident <br/>
Trust me. We could do some real good out there, make some real changes.
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shurui</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br /> 
i really do hate how the news has been covering the protest. they're not even bothering to cover why we were protesting in the first place, it's ridiculous 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Z-e-D</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:17</span><br /> 
I'm already planning on helping Ryukyu but I could always use extra hands.

 Mostly a lot of yelling about how I should get my head out of my ass and I'm not the only one having a hard time and he's right but why does he have to be so annoying about it? I hate it when Kacchan is right and he's almost always right and it's the WORST. Because he also has no patience for your feelings or your specific situation so it's just "get over it already" and "if it's not working out then stop doing it" and it's just SO UNHELPFUL

   If you had attended the protest, I just wanted to say that there was nothing illegal about attending and the escalation was nobody's fault and you shouldn't feel bad about it. The protest was for a good cause and I hope the HPSC sees that before it's too late.

  and change is messy and it sucks that you're at the center of all this. but maybe the best thing you can do to make up for it is to keep going. to keep telling people they matter, and that they can make a difference. that if something is terrible, it doesn't have to stay that way forever

</span>

<span class="line-box-right1">
I did do that but then some stuff happened and now we're talking again and I still feel really nervous and guilty about it but I can't just ignore him forever, that would make me an asshole 
</span><span class="line-time-right">

  <p class="sms-time">Friday, Oct 9 &bull; 21:23</p>
  <p>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Hey
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Bakugou let me know I was being an ass
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  And I guess I kind of was
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Sorry
</span>

<p class="sms-time">21:23</p>
<p>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Are you talking to me again?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I know I haven't been the best friend to you the last few days but you don't have to throw my apology in my face
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Fine I get it. It was a shitty apology
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I really am sorry though
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I've been freaking out about everything that's been happening and you didn't deserve me lashing out at you
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Just to confirm 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  We really are talking again, correct?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Todoroki what more do you want from me?
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I said I was sorry
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I want to know if you're talking to me again
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Because you got mad last time I tried to talk to you
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I'm sorry for getting mad, ok?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Ok
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  First, you should text Himiko. She's been very worried. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Second, I don't have anyone else to tell this to 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  You've been talking to Himiko??
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Wait tell what to
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Shuttai is Midoriya
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  What
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  It's so obvious in hindsight.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  The college, the quirkless activism, the talk at QCON, Shuttai avoiding me, the "legal troubles"
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  How else would he know Crawler, when Crawler is a vigilante? 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Crawler is a professional and on the gray side of the law, he wouldn't mix his friend groups. Midoriya wouldn't know him unless he was also participating in vigilantism, and how would he do that when he's quirkless? Obviously, by being Shuttai. 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
He's not subtle. How has no one else figured this out? 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  I suppose Bakugou has, but he knew Midoriya before all of this 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Maybe Midoriya isn't quirkless and his quirk is an inattention forcefield. It's hard to comprehend how else he could have been successfully anonymous this entire time. Plus a quirk like that would be hard to detect 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  He told me his mother has a levitation quirk, but mutations happen. And I don't know what his father's quirk is, so maybe it's not a mutation at all 
</span>


<span class="sms-box-left">
  Todoroki 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I don't want this to come off the wrong way 
</span>


<span class="sms-box-right">
  ?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  We're still friends 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
 I'm still talking to you
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  But I need you to do me a favor 
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Okay?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
I am begging you 
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Go outside
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  Touch some grass 
</span>
