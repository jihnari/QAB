  I was scoping out date spots!! There's this super cute boba place with really high reviews but I wanted to make sure the quality of the tea was up to snuff. And it was pretty good!! Plus there's a cute cake shop right next door so if she doesn't want to go for boba OR if she wants something to munch on with her tea, it's right there! I didn't buy any of the cake but it looks really good and the line was pretty long.

Look I get that QAB is a controversial topic right now, but you know what we SHOULD be talking about? Prelude, and his anti-mutant rhetoric, and all the misinformation he's been spreading using his platforms. How he hasn't been banned yet is a mystery to me.

    Fucking ridiculous, these QAB white knights never offer up any explanation or defense. All they do is throw around baseless accusations. How the fuck is Prelude anti-evolutionary?? It's like you're not even paying attention.

<span class=dc-link>@everyone</span> hey all, sorry for the ping but we thought it important to keep you updated.
<br/><br/>
as you might have noticed, we've had an influx of new members to the server and a large number of them have been, in the mods' professional opinion: assholes. a popular twitter account boosted the invite link, and that particular twitter user doesn't have the best opinion of QAB. many of the new users are likewise not QABs biggest fans. however, their behavior is not an acceptable excuse to be an asshole back, or to break any of the rules of this discord server.
<br/><br/>
speaking of, <strong>we've updated the server <span class="dc-link">#rules</span></strong> so please take a look. the three strike system is still in effect, but <strong>any threats against another user will get you banned instantly</strong>. there is no "war", you are not "protecting your nation", this is a couple of trolls acting in bad faith, and the mods will take care of it. be patient and civil and we'll get through this together.
<br/><br/>
<strong>all invite links to this discord have been disabled until further notice.</strong> we're going back to the beginning times where each new user had to interview with a mod before being allowed into the server, and we expect that to take up a lot of time and energy so please be understanding. (also, if you're interested in helping out as a temporary mod in any capacity, let me or <span class=dc-link>@engineman</span> know.)
<br/><br/>
as always, please don't hesitate to DM anyone on the <span class=dc-link>@mod</span> team if someone is making you uncomfortable.
<br/><br/>
finally: <strong>please pay attention to how you're behaving in public spaces.</strong> there's been some doxxing going around and it's better to be safe than sorry.
<br/><span class="dc-emotebox">241 👍</span> <span class="dc-emotebox">95 🙏</span> <span class="dc-emotebox">33 😔</span>

  <p>
"—We're recording now. Could you state that again, for the record?"
</p><p>
"Shit man, I shouldn't even be here."
</p><p>
"No one has to know you're involved until we have enough to convict. You might not even have to testify. But unless I have some semblance of proof, some actual evidence, a judge will never grant a warrant."
</p><p>
"You think I fucking know what that means?"
</p><p>
"It means the Hassaikai keeps running free, no restrictions, and maybe finally comes to collect the debt you don't have the money to pay."
</p><p>
"Shit. Okay, okay, so like I said, everyone's all up in a panic. I've never seen them this worked up. After Yonamine got arrested, things got locked down <span class="text-normal">tight</span>, but it was still just routine you know? Shit happens, people get arrested. But then the boss' daughter just up and vanishes."
</p><p>
"And she didn't turn back up?"
</p><p>
"No, there's nothing, no trace of her, no footage—<span class="text-normal">nothing</span>."
</p><p>
"When did she disappear?"
</p><p>
"I dunno, Wednesday? Thursday?"
</p><p>
"Okay. Can you repeat what you said about Stain?"
</p><p>
"Man, he was everywhere. You try to do a drug deal and he was there. You try to extort cash from some civvies, he was there. You go to goddamn lunch and he was fucking goddamn <span class="text-normal">there.</span> And it wasn't just me—it was everybody. Our numbers are way lower than they're supposed to be and Kurono—second in command, stickler for the rules, total asshat—was on everyone's asses and he didn't care why it was happening, just that we weren't doing what we were told. I'm just a grunt, I'm not even in the clan, they don't tell me shit and he's still threatened to kill me a few times. For no goddamn good reason! But he's still better than dealing with Chisaki directly, Jesus Christ—You know what his quirk is?"
</p><p>
"I have an idea, yeah."
</p><p>
"He can turn you <span class="text-normal">inside fucking out</span> and keep you alive to see it. There's no limit to it, he can keep you there for hours and hours and then put you back to take a breather, and then do it all over again. Shit, man. I'd take death by Kurono any day."
</p><p>
"Yeah, I hear you. But you were saying, about Stain?"
</p><p>
"Right, yeah, Stain. And he's with the League, right? Sort of, anyway. So the Stain is everywhere but the higher-ups can't be bothered to deal with him because it'd make things messy, even though the fucker's not shy about swinging those swords of his around. Nearly killed Nemoto and he's a shoe in for lieutenant, that would have meant an all-out fucking war."
</p><p>
"Is Chisaki afraid of going head to head with the League?"
</p><p>
"What? No, he'd kill those assholes in a second. They have some sort of—deal? Don't ask me. I've seen a few of them come and go from the main compound, and I'm not allowed to even set foot in there. We all think that's why Chisaki hasn't just killed Stain already, but then the kid disappeared. And, you know."
</p><p>
"Know what?"
</p><p>
"So did Stain."

  Hm. But he can't come forward and directly claim the credit because of whatever he has going on with the League.

<span class="line-box-right1">
  That's what it sounds like
</span><span class="line-time-right">
Read<br/>14:45

</span>

<span class=line-box-left>
  Since Erukkido hasn't been burned to the ground, I assume the League doesn't yet suspect.
</span><span class="line-time-left">14:46

</span>

<span class="line-box-right1">
  That's what I was thinking, too. But then what happened to the girl? The League stays away from QAB stuff, but Stain was clearly a fan. Or maybe even a member. Sure, it's one thing if the League finds out who killed Stain. But what about if QAB finds out?
</span><span class="line-time-right">
Read<br/>14:47

</span>

<span class=line-box-left>
  There's no way to say. QAB is too unpredictable, but even so I suspect their reaction would be drastic, to say the least.
</span><span class="line-time-left">14:48

</span>
<span class=line-box-left-m>
  You're missing an important question. If Stain is dead, what happened to the child?
</span><span class="line-time-left">14:48

</span>

<span class="line-box-right1">
  Do you think Stain did something?
</span><span class="line-time-right">
Read<br/>14:48

</span>

<span class=line-box-left>
  I know that's what the informant seemed to believe, but given Stain's MO it seems unlikely. That's not to say we should rule it out, but we should consider other angles. Especially if the hunt is ongoing; that means they haven't yet found a body.
</span><span class="line-time-left">
14:48
</span>
<span class=line-box-left-m>
  Think about it. In the case Stain had nothing to do with the girl's disappearance, why would Chisaki go after him?

  You said it yourself: Stain has two alliances.

<span class="line-box-right1">
  You think QAB had something to do with this, and Chisaki took Stain out as revenge? For what?
</span><span class="line-time-right">

</span>

<span class=line-box-left>
  Have you forgotten about the Yonamine case? Maybe we're only seeing part of the puzzle here. Consider. Yonamine gets arrested, in part to QAB's interference. Chisaki retaliates in some way we aren't privy to, and in turn QAB sends Stain into Erukkido to hamper Chisaki's operations, but Chisaki can't touch him because of his deal with the League. But remember that explosion in Ibaraki a week ago?
</span><span class="line-time-left">
14:50
</span>
<span class=line-box-left-m>
  QAB is shaping up to be a league of vigilantes. What if the two vigilantes caught in the blast were members? What if that was Chisaki's reply to Stain?

  I think it's an angle worth looking into, at the very least.

    I just wanted to thank you again for the advice! I have a lot to consider.
  </span>

  <span class="sms-box-left">
    I know you may ignore me, but I would like to reiterate. I really don't think you should be doing this alone. Hero work doesn't leave much time for a family, much less solo child rearing. If at all possible, the best case scenario would be to have a second adult involved, to support both you and the child. You shouldn't have to be her only support.
  </span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  haha thats a nice thought
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I'm being serious. Even if it's not a romantic partnership, there are plenty of people who would be willing to assist you, if not in a full-time capacity, at least as an emergency measure.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  My daughter Fuyumi deals with children often, and I'm sure she would be willing to lend a hand.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  okay. thanks.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  I don't think I'm convincing you, but the next time you're in town I invite you to join us for dinner. That way you can meet her on more neutral ground and see if she's someone you would be comfortable leaving your child with.

  The cowards at QAB have shut down the only platform we had to debate with them publicly. While this is a disappointment, it is in no way a surprise.

  If they think this will stop us, they certainly don't know us very well.
