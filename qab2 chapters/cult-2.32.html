I completely ignored that as a weird marketing scheme since it was obviously Ryukyu who took them out but now... I'm doing a lot of rethinking.

Did everyone collectively forget that murder at Hachiko a month ago? The writing was literally on the walls. In blood.

I'm so confused, were they jealous the Preluders got a riot and decided they wanted one too? Who are these chucklefucks? At least Preluders had a mission statement (even if it was anti-mutant bullshit ), what does QAB even stand for?

  </p>
  <p class=news-border>
    Though the Hassaikai organization was dismantled and mass arrests were made, over forty eight hours have passed without a comment from Sir Nighteye, the lead hero on the case. The only public reaction Sir Nighteye has had in relation to this break in the case was at the taunting of the popular @hawks_unofficial Twitter account, allegedly run by Pro Hero Hawks himself. Upon asked for comment, hawks_unofficial had this to say: "why does everyone think im hawks? that dude is way hotter than me. [...] i have no reason to know anything about official pro hero cases, pls stop asking".

    Following the violence yesterday afternoon, officials have blocked off access to the Central Common Government Office.

Police are reviewing security footage, and asking for anyone with any information about the responsible parties to come forward.

      Good news for Kamui Woods fans: the tree hero was spotted in Ikebukuro just yesterday, dressed in his official hero costume. Kamui Woods declined to make a formal comment, but said to expect an announcement from The Lurker's PR team within the next week. Will this announcement mark his return to heroics? Equally likely is that Kamui Woods will finally break his silence on the complicated situation between him, Endeavor, and the series of lawsuits that followed
