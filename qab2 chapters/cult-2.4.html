You met Shouto, right? Did he seem... normal?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:19</span><br />
mmm
<br/>
we didnt stick around to chat but i mean yeah, for a given degree of "normal"
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:25</span><br />
I know he said he was a classmate of Kacchan's, but sometimes he texts like he's 50. And "classmate" could mean a lot of different things, but I've started wondering if he's just someone who WORKS at the same school as Kacchan, because obviously he had too much information about the kidnapping to not be directly involved but maybe he was lying about being a student so that he didn't dox himself, but recently we've been helping each other out with homework and he is WAY better at english than a high schooler should be and I really do need the help with english but what if he knew that and was using it to get past my defences? and he used the phase "given the level of scrutiny placed on his public visage" in a sentence like that was a thing real people do but to be fair to him he hasn't asked for a voice or video chat and he hasn't asked to meet in person so I'm probably overreacting except what if that's what he wants me to think and I'm playing right into his hand?
<br/>
Sorry, that was a lot, I'm a little stressed.
<br/>
What I'm trying to ask is, is Shouto a catfish who wants to lure me into an alley and murder me?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:26</span><br />
oh
<br/>
oh no, no of course not, shouto was like, your age
<br/>
kinda stiff/awkward but in the "humans are loud and confusing, what do" way not serial killer way, he really does go to UA with rai
<br/>
oops you didn't know that about rai
<br/>
okay well i maybe shouldnt have told you but you get the point
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:26</span><br />
Oh okay
<br/>
Well I mean, phew, for one
<br/>
We've been talking more and I guess I just started getting nervous for no reason
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:26</span><br />
dont even worry about it, i get it okay?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 05:27</span><br />

I DID try that, but they're worried about the legalities when the main servers associated with QAB are hosted in America and Sweden. So even though most of the issues we've been seeing are centered around Tokyo, they won't consider QAB a gang or a prosecutable entity, primarily due to the lack of physical, centralized cohesion.

<p class="rd-header">Forced quirk suppression/removal? </p>
  <p>
What does everyone else think about forced quirk suppression? I mean, obviously Prelude is pretty radical, but does he have a point? Wouldn't the truest equality be to remove everyone's quirk, for everyone to have the same base?

I don't disagree that we could "level the playing field" if everyone's quirks were taken out of the equation, but what are you going to do? Forcefully take away quirks people were BORN with?

People would find things to discriminate about even without quirks. Think about skin color, ethnicity, sex, height, IQ. I don't mean to speak directly against Prelude's personal ideals, but IMO removing people's quirks will in no way make the world a better place. All you're doing is trying to take away something that most people identify, consciously or unconsciously, as an integral part of themselves.
<br/><br/>
I've had the opportunity to personally interview people who have become unable to use their due to various circumstances. The majority of them are listless and have difficulty concentrating, as well as difficulty holding down a job. They often develop depression and some fall into suicidal idealization. This INCLUDES people who were previously documented as saying their quirk didn't really matter to them, and didn't use their quirks frequently. Maybe some of this is purely psychological. Maybe it isn't. The majority of these people had experienced traumatic injuries, and that could be a factor. But when compared with individuals with similar injuries, those who had lost the use of their quirk suffered from significantly greater alterations in cognition and mood.
<br/><br/>
I'm also not saying people without quirks are useless; I'm saying that quirks are embedded in DNA, and removing the quirk from a person could have INCREDIBLY unknown and unintended side effects, and that this is a much more complicated issue than people have recently been making it out to be.
