    well!!  <br/>
    ok so the whole raid idea didn't go off with no hitches and that's sort of why i'm here because i think maayybbee it would be a bad idea for me to be in public right now 
    the boss dude got arrested and that's good but it also means everyone who DIDN'T get arrested is super duper pissed off and running around trying to find the leak
    and the leak was me, so  <br/>
    anyway i'm really sorry but i don't think i'll be able to make our date this weekend :((((((
  </p>
  
  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">雷人</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:11</span><br /> 
    That's totally okay!! I'd much rather you be safe

    awww!! i'm fine lol what are they gonna do <br/>
    well i say that but i don't want to give them the chance to ambush me  <br/>
    so i'll probably just stay in this weekend and do nothing and be really bored and miss you a lot 💔 
    <br/><span class="dc-emotebox">🥺 1</span><br/>
    did you have any other plans this weekend?
  </p>

    Nah, Shouto's got like, a date thing
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">✦✮✦༻Blood Love༺✦✮✦</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:12</span><br /> 
    a DATE THING? like a DATE? <br/>
    he's got a DATE? <br/>
    SHOUTO? <br/>
    the same shouto who's awkward robotic cryptid on the qab server? <br/>
    the same shouto who spent two hours trying to convince me that all might has a secret twin brother??
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">雷人</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:13</span><br /> 
    The VERY SAME <br/>
    Somehow he's actually really popular?? I don't know when it happened  <br/>
    Well that's a lie it happened from the very beginning. He's hot, actually, I just didn't think he had any interest in... other humans 
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">✦✮✦༻Blood Love༺✦✮✦</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 09:13</span><br />

    The informant in question had two requests: that details about them be completely anonymous, and that credit for the tip went to a specific organization. I agreed to these terms, under the condition that an arrest was made

  <strong>Fat Gum</strong>'s license has been SUSPENDED pending investigation. Nothing about this is permanent or definitive, the HPSC is just trying to distract us. We need REAL changes and REAL consequences, not just a slap on the wrist.

  Hey! Guess what! It's freaking weird that you'd hound a teenager's DMs for their political hot takes! Blanket statement: I will not be talking about <strong>Fat Gum</strong>, at all. I don't owe any of you anything. Have a backpack boy moodboard, you asshole weirdos

  <strong>Fat Gum</strong>'s suspension is a good first step, but what we really need is system reform. If laws aren't updated, this will happen all over again but this time, the 14yo intern might end up in the hospital, or worse.

        because sometimes shitty things just happen  <br/>
        the HPSC didn't want to own up to the fact that the intern system needs an overhaul and they're making fat gum a scapegoat 
      </p>

      That doesn't change the fact that I brought attention to the issue  <br/>
      I still made this happen <br/>
      What am I supposed to do with that  <br/>
      I don't know what to do 
    </p>

        it's still NOT YOUR FAULT  <br/>
        you didn't call for him to be fired you just pointed out a problem and the problem is REAL you didn't lie you didn't embellish you just told the truth  <br/>
        people did the wrong thing with that truth and that's not on you
      </p>
  
      <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:22</span><br /> 
        If I never said anything, none of this would have ever happened  <br/>
        How is that not my fault 
      </p>

        like, okay  <br/>
        if your mom was buying a car from some sketchy dude and you were really suspicious but you didnt say anything to stop her from buying the car and then a few weeks later the head gasket blew and she had to spend a bunch of money to get it fixed. would it be your fault for not telling her to not buy the car? 
      </p>
  
    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:23</span><br /> 
      Wouldn't it be??
    </p>
  
      <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:23</span><br /> 
        NO it's the sketchy dudes fault  <br/>
        ugh  <br/>
        alright maybe that was a bad example  <br/>
        but if some hero student had gotten themselves killed because of the complete lack of supervision during their internship, could you live with yourself if you could have published that blog post and didnt?

        i dont think you could have  <br/>
        i think you HAD to say something, even if the outcome isn't what you wanted it to be  <br/>
        and honestly, you know what you should do if the outcome isn't what you wanted it to be?

      What 
    </p>
  
      <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:24</span><br /> 
        you should write about it  <br/>
        you should tell people about why this isn't a good thing and that they should stop celebrating what is clearly just the hpsc covering their asses in the worst possible way 
      </p>
  
    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:24</span><br /> 
      I don't know <br/>
      Maybe 
    </p>
  
      <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:25</span><br /> 
        think about it  <br/>
        sleep on it  <br/>
        rewatch some all might videos  <br/>
        this isn't your fault 
      </p>
  
    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:26</span><br /> 
      I've got to go, I have homework

      <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:26</span><br /> 
        okay, you go  <br/>
        but don't beat yourself up about this 
      </p>
  
    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:26</span><br /> 
      I'll try not to
