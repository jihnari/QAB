  <span class="sms-box-right">
    I think I know why Shuttai is always so busy
  </span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  what
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I'm convinced he lives, or lived, in Hosu. He's mentioned taking the Tsukuba line several times, and there's a few older articles that have since been deleted that talked about specific locations in Chiba, but in a way that indicated Shuttai only commutes to the area. That means he must live on the Tokyo side of the Tsukuba line, and given the length of his commute and which times he's taking the train, he must transfer at least once.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  You know what's in Chiba? Toudai. Specifically, the quirk research branch.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  And that would make him busy enough, seeing as Toudai is the top university in Japan. But as far as I can gather, he doesn't attend full-time, and why would that be?
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  What if he's a father?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  ??????
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  It would certainly explain why he's been so secretive about himself, and also why he doesn't seem to understand or interact with social media
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  😒
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  It would also explain why he doesn't have the time to attend classes full time. He probably has a job, and he's taking classes on nights and weekends to switch to a better career.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  I've given a lot of thought as to his job, and I think it must be something that allows for him to write part of the time. A shop attendant, maybe? Or perhaps a normal office job, but one that is clearly under-challenging him
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  do you sleep
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I don't have time for sleep
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Todoroki go to bed challenge
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I don't know what that means.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  here's what it means:
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  please
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  for me
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  for my family

<span class="sms-box-left">

<span class="sms-box-left">
  for my SANITY

  go. to. bed.

<span class="sms-box-right">

<span class="sms-box-right">
