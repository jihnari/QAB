[8:47 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: Hm?
[8:47 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: What function do these black hooks serve???
[8:47 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: Where r they from?
[8:47 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: I think they probably were part of a thing but all i have is these hooks and I'm afraid to throw them out but also have no clue why I'd keep them
[8:48 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: My office/junk drawer
[8:48 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: I've no idea, I'm searching up 'black plastic hooks' and hoping they come u0

[8:49 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: ??
[8:49 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Same no luck so far. I may put them in my "throw away if you don't figure it out in a month" pile
[8:50 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: They're pretty flimsy. I feel like maybe they are weird bungee cord attachments?? Why are they so mysterious
[8:51 PM] Volanna l Praise Jesus!Teal'c: What did they come with?
[8:51 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Nothing at this point. I'm sure they came with something else but whatever it was is elsewhere or already gone
[8:52 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Typing it out I'm leaning towards the "toss them" option. They don't seem critical to anything i have they're just random plastic
[8:55 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes:

[8:58 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: No :( thank you for helping me trawl google but i think they're gonna remain mystery plastic
[8:58 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: Alright, good luck with the mystery plastic then XD
[8:58 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Exciting Friday night ðŸ˜‚
[9:07 PM] jihn | george time: they definitely look like they're made to go into a thing

[9:35 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Right like there must be cords of some kind
[9:35 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: They aren't bungee hooks
[9:35 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio:
Image
[9:35 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: They look kinda like those snap clips
[9:36 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: The bottom bit looks like it should hook into something
[9:36 PM] Lar | curse u & ur peepaw jokes: But the weird flat ones, not the trident ones

[9:38 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: If this helps I'm bad at reverse image search and heres one by itself

[9:41 PM] Shuttai | á•¦Ê• â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”á•¤: im losing my mind
[9:41 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Its not like this
[9:41 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: It may hook into a thing like the base piece tho
[9:42 PM] Shuttai | á•¦Ê• â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”á•¤: yea thats sort of what i was thinking??
[9:42 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Made of ABS plastic
[9:42 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: I think a base piece that would hook into it and let it swivel is missing
[9:42 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: But then the qn is - what does it hold?
[9:42 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: Not a lanyard for an ID or key
[9:45 PM] jihn | george time: im wondering if they were just in box to hold some things in place, but. why then, is one side detailed and the other not? why the indent for something to go into?
[9:46 PM] Reeves | trustworthy Scorpio: One side is definitely "nicer" implying an inward and outward facing side
[9:47 PM] jihn | george time: right??
[9:51 PM] Shuttai | á•¦Ê• â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”á•¤: i can't find it tonight if i figure it out ill let you know,,
