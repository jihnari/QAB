[8:47 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Hm?
[8:47 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: What function do these black hooks serve???
[8:47 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Where r they from?
[8:47 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: I think they probably were part of a thing but all i have is these hooks and I'm afraid to throw them out but also have no clue why I'd keep them
[8:48 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: My office/junk drawer
[8:48 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: I've no idea, I'm searching up 'black plastic hooks' and hoping they come u0
[8:49 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron:
Image
[8:49 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: ??
[8:49 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Same no luck so far. I may put them in my "throw away if you don't figure it out in a month" pile
[8:50 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: They're pretty flimsy. I feel like maybe they are weird bungee cord attachments?? Why are they so mysterious
[8:51 PM] Volanna | Soup is good: What did they come with?
[8:51 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Nothing at this point. I'm sure they came with something else but whatever it was is elsewhere or already gone
[8:52 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Typing it out I'm leaning towards the "toss them" option. They don't seem critical to anything i have they're just random plastic
[8:55 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron:
Image
[8:55 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: I've found this so far
[8:55 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Wayyyy down on a Google search
[8:55 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Do u think it's the same thug
[8:56 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Thing
[8:56 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: No it doesn't have a closed loop its like anchor shaped
[8:56 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Mm

[8:57 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: ?
[8:57 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: This looks like it night be it but in a different position
[8:58 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: No :( thank you for helping me trawl google but i think they're gonna remain mystery plastic
[8:58 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: Alright, good luck with the mystery plastic then XD
[8:58 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Exciting Friday night üòÇ
[9:07 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: they definitely look like they're made to go into a thing
[9:08 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: ive got a ton of random plastic im too scared to toss out, but unlike you they go in the mystery drawer forever
[9:09 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: could it have held smth?? like, fishing wire or whatever comes on interesting shaped things like that
[9:13 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: okay i too have failed at google. if you can't live with not knowing, id post it to r/whatisthisthing, they are very good at their jobs
[9:24 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: @Reeves | Soup Switzerland does the bottom bit turn??

[9:26 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: @Reeves | Soup Switzerland this has consumed my every waking thought i must find them
[9:28 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: can confirm, we're on a vc and shu is reverse image searching and texting people and searching all existing buckle things on some random website
[9:29 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: I'm having a breakdown

[9:31 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: reeves has abandoned me
[9:31 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: in your time of need
[9:31 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: like Sisyphus i am bound to hell

Image
[9:33 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: They're solid with no moving parts
[9:33 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: so like, 1.5 (inch)
[9:33 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Oh i have a ruler
[9:33 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: they look kind of weirdly familiar
[9:33 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: i have SEEN THESE BEFORE
[9:33 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: idk when
[9:33 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: idk where
[9:33 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: but
[9:33 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland:
Image
[9:34 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: They're so familiar
[9:34 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Exactly correct
[9:34 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: IM SO SMART
[9:34 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: There's four
[9:34 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: emotionally they feel like they come in a kit when you're building something
[9:35 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Right like there must be cords of some kind
[9:35 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: They aren't bungee hooks
[9:35 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland:
Image
[9:35 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: They look kinda like those snap clips
[9:36 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: The bottom bit looks like it should hook into something
[9:36 PM] Lar | anti-soup squadron: But the weird flat ones, not the trident ones
[9:38 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland:
Image
[9:38 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: If this helps I'm bad at reverse image search and heres one by itself
[9:40 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: reverse image search isnt helping me personally
[9:40 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç:
1 Inch Plastic Swivel Snap Hooks | West Coast Paracord
[9:40 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: so the base feels like this???

[9:41 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç:
Plastic ClaspPlastic cord endRope buckleBuckles Clasps for image 1
[9:41 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: im losing my mind
[9:41 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Its not like this
[9:41 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: It may hook into a thing like the base piece tho
[9:42 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: yea thats sort of what i was thinking??
[9:42 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Made of ABS plastic
[9:42 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: I think a base piece that would hook into it and let it swivel is missing
[9:42 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: But then the qn is - what does it hold?
[9:42 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: Not a lanyard for an ID or key
[9:45 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: im wondering if they were just in box to hold some things in place, but. why then, is one side detailed and the other not? why the indent for something to go into?
[9:46 PM] Reeves | Soup Switzerland: One side is definitely "nicer" implying an inward and outward facing side
[9:47 PM] crawler | anti-soup captain: right??
[9:51 PM] Shuttai | soup radical ü§ç: i can't find it tonight if i figure it out ill let you know,,
