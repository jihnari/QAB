hello and welcome to <span class="dc-link">#tikka-masala</span>. only those with the illustrious "true bro" role can view this channel, and new "true bro"s will be added upon personal referral only. we've created this channel to handle the more delicate requests that come in via  <span class="dc-link">#curry</span>. access to this channel is limited to people who know what they're doing and aren't at risk of "ratting us out", so to speak. we are NOT advocating for vigilantism (because that would be illegal), but we're not going to stop helping people in need. hopefully this channel can be used to settle things CALMLY, PROFESSIONALLY, and MOSTLY LEGALLY. <br/>

My teacher told us today that red hair was a dominant gene. But my father has red hair, and my siblings both have my mother's hair color. Is there such a thing as one gene being more dominant than the other?

<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shuttai </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:36</span><br />
Oh, that's a good question. Is there any mixing of the color? Like, is the hair entirely your mother's color?
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name-default">Shouto </span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 18:36</span><br />
No, there's some red mixed in

is there anything you can do on your own that could help with promotion? nothing too big or that would get you into trouble with your boss, but like... running a company twitter? idk if you boss would give permission for something like that though
