I'm having some trouble properly communicating with a new friend. He denies that we're friends, but everything I've learned about friendship indicates that we are engaged in one. How can I know for sure?

<xfcv or whoever>
  <p><span class="dc-name color-purple">XCFV | obscore</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:21</span><br />

  <p><span class="dc-name color-yellow">Saffron | gym leader</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:22</span><br />
xcfv said it inelegantly, but maybe part of the problem is that you're trying too hard? if you back off a little and let him come to you, he might relax about it.</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />We eat lunch at the same table several times a week, and he's the one to seek me out. he complained about my "poor skills" in a certain school subject and set up a study group for the upcoming test so he could "make sure I didn't embarrass the whole class". (I got the wrong answer on two problems on the homework assignment, and I'm consistently ranked third in our class.)

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
So we hang out together at his insistence, which seems like friendship. But he often tells me I suck at things. I don't take it personally because that seems to be the way he talks to everyone, but my other friend says that means he doesn't like me. And if he doesn't like me, then we're not friends. </p>

<shuttai>
  <p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | "suck it"</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
Look at it this way: if he's complaining about you to your face, he's not doing it behind your back!<br/>
It sounds like he's a very straight forward person. If he's eating lunch with you, that means he values you enough to spend time with you. </p>

<shouto>
  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
He does occasionally make me food, but he says it's because he "doesn't want me to use it as an excuse when he beats me". </p>

<shuttai>
  <p><span class="dc-name color-forest">Shuttai | "suck it"</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:27</span><br />
He might just have a hard time expressing his emotions. He spends time with you, he does nice things for you... That sounds like friendship to me.<br/>
From personal experience though, you might want to be careful about pushing too hard for any hard answers or relying on him to have reasonable emotional responses to things. He might lash out when he gets confused or embarrassed. </p>

<shouto>
  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:27</span><br />
Oh. That helps explain some things. Thank you very much, Shuttai.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

There's been a lot of discussion about my political views, and my so-called "quirkless activism" comes up quite a bit. I don't consider myself an activist per-say, but I see quirklessness as an issue society largely ignores.

In a world where the first field after your full name is a quirk, erasure is a larger issue than you might consider. When applying online for a high school entrance exam, did the 'quirk type' field give you any pause? Did you notice there were only three options; emitter, transformation, and mutant?

This is a required field of entry for forms you'll fill out for your entire life. Especially in forms geared towards the younger generation (i.e., high school and college applications), forms must be competed online and they're missing something important: a fourth option, for those without quirks.
