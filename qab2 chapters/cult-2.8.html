As you are all likely aware, Yonamine Tatsuo was brought in yesterday under charges of disturbing the peace. Yonamine has known ties to the Hassaikai and it is vital that we find additional evidence between now and his hearing. If we let him go, the Hassaikai are unlikely to be so careless again.
<br/><br/>
A minor and an unaccompanied provisional hero were at the scene during the incident that caused the initial charges. The identity of the minor is still unknown, but we were able to bring in the provisional hero for questioning. We strongly suspect he has an affiliation with the group known as QAB given QAB's pattern of behavior over the last month, but were unable to confirm during the questioning.
<br/><br/>
If QAB is involved, that would officially make this a turf war and may work in our favor insofar as delaying Yonamine's court date as much as possible to allow us to gather additional evidence to support our case.
<br/><br/>
Contact me directly if you come across anything related to Yonamine, the Hassaikai, or QAB.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't a turf war give us jurisdiction to treat "Shuttai" as a potential obstruction of justice?
